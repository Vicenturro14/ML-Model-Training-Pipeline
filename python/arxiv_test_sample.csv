2401.15960,Xiaochen Li,"Xiaochen Li, Sicong Liu, Zimu Zhou, Bin Guo, Yuan Xu and Zhiwen Yu","EchoPFL: Asynchronous Personalized Federated Learning on Mobile Devices
  with On-Demand Staleness Control",accepted by Ubicomp2024,,10.1145/3643560,,cs.DC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  The rise of mobile devices with abundant sensory data and local computing
capabilities has driven the trend of federated learning (FL) on these devices.
And personalized FL (PFL) emerges to train specific deep models for each mobile
device to address data heterogeneity and varying performance preferences.
However, mobile training times vary significantly, resulting in either delay
(when waiting for slower devices for aggregation) or accuracy decline (when
aggregation proceeds without waiting). In response, we propose a shift towards
asynchronous PFL, where the server aggregates updates as soon as they are
available. Nevertheless, existing asynchronous protocols are unfit for PFL
because they are devised for federated training of a single global model. They
suffer from slow convergence and decreased accuracy when confronted with severe
data heterogeneity prevalent in PFL. Furthermore, they often exclude slower
devices for staleness control, which notably compromises accuracy when these
devices possess critical personalized data. Therefore, we propose EchoPFL, a
coordination mechanism for asynchronous PFL. Central to EchoPFL is to include
updates from all mobile devices regardless of their latency. To cope with the
inevitable staleness from slow devices, EchoPFL revisits model broadcasting. It
intelligently converts the unscalable broadcast to on-demand broadcast,
leveraging the asymmetrical bandwidth in wireless networks and the dynamic
clustering-based PFL. Experiments show that compared to status quo approaches,
EchoPFL achieves a reduction of up to 88.2% in convergence time, an improvement
of up to 46% in accuracy, and a decrease of 37% in communication costs

  Research (TMLR)",,,,cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV stat.ML,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Generative foundation models are susceptible to implicit biases that can
arise from extensive unsupervised training data. Such biases can produce
suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially serious
consequences. Consequently, aligning these models with human ethics and
preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible and
effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has primarily
employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to address this
problem, where generative models are fine-tuned with RL algorithms guided by a
human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the inefficiencies and
instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently present substantial
obstacles to the successful alignment, necessitating the development of a more
robust and streamlined approach. To this end, we introduce a new framework,
Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT), designed to align generative models
effectively. Utilizing a reward model and a sufficient number of samples, our
approach selects the high-quality samples, discarding those that exhibit
undesired behavior, and subsequently enhancing the model by fine-tuning on
these filtered samples. Our studies show that RAFT can effectively improve the
model performance in both reward learning and other automated metrics in both
large language models and diffusion models.

treated within a Floquet scheme. The continuum problem of the photoelectron is
solved using a complex absorbing potential. Rate equations for the ionic

topographic features on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. We observe that the
cumulative cliff height distribution across the surface follows a power law
with a slope equal to -1.69 +- 0.02. When this distribution is studied
independently for each region, we find a good correlation between the slope of
the power law and the orbital erosion rate of the surface. For instance, the
northern hemisphere topography is dominated by structures on the 100~m scale
while the southern hemisphere topography, illuminated at perihelion, is
dominated by 10~m scale terrain features. Our study suggest that the current
size of a cliff is controlled not only by material cohesion but by the dominant
erosional process in each region. This observation can be generalized to other
comets, where we argue that primitive nuclei are characterized by the presence
of large cliffs with a cumulative height power index equal to or above -1.5,
while older, eroded cometary surfaces have a power index equal to or below
-2.3. In effect, our model shows that a measure of the topography provides a
quantitative assessment of a comet's erosional history, i.e. its evolutionary
age.

have attracted considerable recent attention due to their computational
simplicity, analytic tractability, and wide applicability in optimization and
statistical inference problems. This paper presents a systematic framework for
incorporating such approximate message passing (AMP) methods in general
graphical models. The key concept is a partition of dependencies of a general
graphical model into strong and weak edges, with the weak edges representing
interactions through aggregates of small, linearizable couplings of variables.
AMP approximations based on the Central Limit Theorem can be readily applied to
aggregates of many weak edges and integrated with standard message passing
updates on the strong edges. The resulting algorithm, which we call hybrid
generalized approximate message passing (HyGAMP), can yield significantly
simpler implementations of sum-product and max-sum loopy belief propagation. By
varying the partition of strong and weak edges, a performance--complexity
trade-off can be achieved. Group sparsity and multinomial logistic regression
problems are studied as examples of the proposed methodology.

  Multiple-Packet Reception",,,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This paper considers the slotted ALOHA protocol in a communication channel
shared by N users. It is assumed that the channel has the multiple-packet
reception (MPR) capability that allows the correct reception of up to M ($1
\leq M < N$) time-overlapping packets. To evaluate the reliability in the
scenario that a packet needs to be transmitted within a strict delivery
deadline D ($D \geq 1$) (in unit of slot) since its arrival at the head of
queue, we consider the successful delivery probability (SDP) of a packet as
performance metric of interest. We derive the optimal transmission probability
that maximizes the SDP for any $1 \leq M < N$ and any $D \geq 1$, and show it
can be computed by a fixed-point iteration. In particular, the case for D = 1
(i.e., throughput maximization) is first completely addressed in this paper.
Based on these theoretical results, for real-life scenarios where N may be
unknown and changing, we develop a distributed algorithm that enables each user
to tune its transmission probability at runtime according to the estimate of N.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective in dynamic
scenarios, with near-optimal performance.

presented. The analysis is based on data collected in proton-proton collisions
at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. The hypothetical resonance is
produced with sufficiently high transverse momentum that its decay products are
merged into a single jet with two-prong substructure. A signal would be
identified as a peak over a smoothly falling background in the distribution of
the invariant mass of the jet, using novel jet substructure techniques. No
evidence for such a resonance is observed within the mass range of 50-300 GeV.
Upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section,
and presented in a mass-coupling parameter space. The limits further constrain
simplified models of dark matter production involving a mediator interacting
between quarks and dark matter particles through a vector or axial-vector
current. In the framework of these models, the results are the most sensitive
to date, extending for the first time the search region to masses below 100
GeV.

susceptibility and the coexistence diameter. Our results clearly show that the
interfacial tension vanishes at the critical point with exponent 2\nu ~ 1.26.
This is in good agreement with the 3D Ising exponent. Also calculated are
critical amplitude ratios, which are shown to be compatible with the
corresponding 3D Ising values. We additionally identify a number of subtleties
that are encountered when finite size scaling is applied to the AO model. In

uniform rectilinear motion and a Brownian motion. They are formed by successive
steps of random finite lengths and directions travelled at a fixed speed. The
isotropic and symmetric one-dimensional persistent random walk is governed by
the telegrapher's equation, also called hyperbolic heat conduction equation.
These equations have been designed to resolve the paradox of the infinite speed
in the heat and diffusion equations. The finiteness of both the speed and the
correlation length leads to several classes of random walks: Persistent random
walk in one dimension can display anomalies that cannot arise for Brownian
motion such as anisotropy and asymmetries. In this work we focus on the case
where the mean free path is anisotropic, the only anomaly leading to a physics
that is different from the telegrapher's case. We derive exact expression of
its Green's function, for its scattering statistics and distribution of
first-passage time at the origin. The phenomenology of the latter shows a
transition for quantities like the escape probability and the residence time.

regimes, and their activity levels are well described by Ro, the ratio between
P_rot and the convective turnover time. Very young PMS stars show, similarly to
MS stars, intense magnetic activity. However they do not show clear
activity-rotation trends, and it still debated which stellar parameters
determine their magnetic activity levels. To bridge the gap between MS and PMS
stars, we studied the activity-rotation relation in the young cluster h Per, a
~13 Myr old cluster, that contains both fast and slow rotators, whose members
have ended their accretion phase and have already developed a radiative core.
It offers us the opportunity to study the activity level of intermediate-age
PMS stars with different rotational velocities, excluding any interactions with
the circumstellar environment. We constrained the magnetic activity levels of h
Per members measuring their X-ray emission from a Chandra observation, while
P_rot were obtained by Moraux et al. (2013). We collected a final catalog of
414 h Per members with known P_rot, T_eff, M_star, with 169 of them having also
detected X-ray emission. We found that h Per members, with 1.0 M_sun < M_star <
1.4 M_sun, display different activity regimes: fast rotators show
supersaturation, while slower rotators have activity levels compatible to the
non-saturated regime. At 13 Myr h Per is therefore the youngest cluster showing
activity-rotation regimes analogous to that of MS stars, indicating that, at
this age, magnetic field production is likely regulated by the alpha-Omega type
dynamo. Moreover we observed that supersaturation is better described by P_rot
than Ro, and that the observed patterns are compatible with the hypothesis of
centrifugal stripping. In this scenario we inferred that coronae can produce
structures as large as ~2 R_star above the stellar surface.

many different scales and in different layers of the solar atmosphere.
  Jets are believed to be induced by magnetic reconnection, a process central
to many astrophysical phenomena. Within the solar atmosphere, jet-like events
develop in many different environments, e.g., in the vicinity of active regions
as well as in coronal holes, and at various scales, from small photospheric
spicules to large coronal jets. In all these events, signatures of helical
structure and/or twisting/rotating motions are regularly observed. The present
study aims to establish that a single model can generally reproduce the
observed properties of these jet-like events.
  In this study, using our state-of-the-art numerical solver ARMS, we present a
parametric study of a numerical tridimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model
of solar jet-like events. Within the MHD paradigm, we study the impact of
varying the atmospheric plasma $\beta$ on the generation and properties of
solar-like jets.
  The parametric study validates our model of jets for plasma $\beta$ ranging
from $10^{-3}$ to $1$, typical of the different layers and magnetic
environments of the solar atmosphere. Our model of jets can robustly explain
the generation of helical solar jet-like events at various $\beta \le 1$. This
study introduces the new result that the plasma $\beta$ modifies the morphology
of the helical jet, explaining the different observed shapes of jets at
different scales and in different layers of the solar atmosphere.
  Our results allow us to understand the energisation, triggering, and driving
processes of jet-like events. Our model allows us to make predictions of the
impulsiveness and energetics of jets as determined by the surrounding
environment, as well as the morphological properties of the resulting jets.

independence, from pairwise independence up to (full) independence. Pairwise
totalness, totalness and other intermediate concepts are also introduced, which
roughly express that the subspaces overlap strongly among themselves, and they
cover the full Hilbert space. A duality between independence and totalness,
that involves orthocomplementation (logical NOT operation), is discussed.
Another approach to independence is also studied, using Rota's formalism on
independent partitions of the Hilbert space. This is used to define
informational independence, which is proved to be equivalent to independence.

  Our key contribution is the proposal of TerpreT, a domain-specific language
for expressing program synthesis problems. TerpreT is similar to a
probabilistic programming language: a model is composed of a specification of a
program representation (declarations of random variables) and an interpreter
describing how programs map inputs to outputs (a model connecting unknowns to
observations). The inference task is to observe a set of input-output examples
and infer the underlying program. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it
enables rapid exploration of a range of domains, program representations, and
interpreter models. Second, it separates the model specification from the
inference algorithm, allowing like-to-like comparisons between different
approaches to inference. From a single TerpreT specification we automatically
perform inference using four different back-ends. These are based on gradient
descent, linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical models, discrete
satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis system.
  We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models
and performing an empirical comparison between alternative inference
algorithms. Our key empirical finding is that constraint solvers dominate the
gradient descent and LP-based formulations. We conclude with suggestions for
the machine learning community to make progress on program synthesis.

involve a generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM)-based modem as a
core part of the baseband processing. Some are based on GFDM with a single
prototype filter, e.g. orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
others employ multiple filters such as filter bank multicarrier (FBMC).
Moreover, the GFDM degrees of freedom combined with multiple prototype filters
design allow the development and optimization of new waveforms. Nevertheless,
GFDM has been widely considered as a complex modulation because of the
requirements of odd number of subcarriers or subsymbols. Accordingly, the
current state of the art implementations consume high resources. One solution
to reduce the complexity is utilizing radix-2 parameters. Due to the
advancement in GFDM filter design, the constraint of using odd parameters has
been overcome and radix-2 realization is now possible. In this paper, we
propose a unified low complexity architecture that can be reconfigured to
provide both time-domain and frequency-domain modulation/demodulation. The
design consists of several radix-2 fast Fourier transform (FFT) and memory
blocks, in addition to one complex multiplier. Moreover, we provide a unified
architecture for the state of the art implementations, which is designed based
on direct computation of circular convolution using parallel multiplier chains.
As we demonstrate in this work, the FFTbased architecture is computationally
more efficient, provides more flexibility, significantly reduces the resource
consumption, and achieves similar latency for larger block size.

recognition. If we define the context of the interaction to be the objects
involved, then most current methods can be categorized as either: (i) training
a single classifier on the combination of the interaction and its context; or
(ii) aiming to recognize the interaction independently of its explicit context.
Both methods suffer limitations: the former scales poorly with the number of
combinations and fails to generalize to unseen combinations, while the latter
often leads to poor interaction recognition performance due to the difficulty
of designing a context-independent interaction classifier. To mitigate those
drawbacks, this paper proposes an alternative, context-aware interaction
recognition framework. The key to our method is to explicitly construct an
interaction classifier which combines the context, and the interaction. The
context is encoded via word2vec into a semantic space, and is used to derive a
classification result for the interaction.
  The proposed method still builds one classifier for one interaction (as per
type (ii) above), but the classifier built is adaptive to context via weights
which are context dependent. The benefit of using the semantic space is that it
naturally leads to zero-shot generalizations in which semantically similar
contexts (subjectobject pairs) can be recognized as suitable contexts for an
interaction, even if they were not observed in the training set.

coexist - arising from within the same f-electron degrees of freedom. Here we
present ambient pressure quantum oscillation measurements on CeIn3 that
crucially identify the electronic structure - potentially similar to high
temperature superconductors. Heavy pockets of f-character are revealed in
CeIn3, undergoing an unexpected effective mass divergence well before the
antiferromagnetic critical field. We thus uncover the softening of a branch of
quasiparticle excitations located away from the traditional spin-fluctuation
dominated antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. The observed Fermi surface
of dispersive f-electrons in CeIn3 could potentially explain the emergence of
Cooper pairs from within a strong moment antiferromagnet.

language, allow various different properties of a program's behaviour to be
tracked via annotating types with additional information, which we call grades.
One example of such a property, often used as a case study in prior work on
graded types, is information flow control, in which types are graded by a
lattice of security levels allowing noninterference properties to be
automatically verified and enforced. These typically focus on one particular
aspect of security, however, known as confidentiality; public outputs are
prohibited from depending on private inputs. Integrity, a property specifying
that trusted outputs must not depend on untrusted inputs, has not been examined
in this context.
  This short paper aims to remedy this omission. It is well-known that
confidentiality and integrity are in some sense dual properties, but simply
reversing the ordering of the security lattice turns out to be unsatisfactory
for the purpose of combining both kinds of property in a single system, at
least in our setting. We analogize the situation to recent work on embedding
both linear and uniqueness types in a graded framework, and use this framing to
demonstrate that we can enforce both integrity and confidentiality alongside
one another. The main idea is to add an additional flavour of modality
annotated for integrity, such that the existing graded comonad for tracking
confidentiality now also acts as a relative monad over the new modality, with
rules allowing information to flow from trusted to public to private.

addition, we used deep multi-band UBVRI photometry to get fundamental
parameters of the cluster via isochrone fitting on the most likely cluster
members, reducing inaccuracies due to field stars.The distance of the OC NGC
2453 (4.7 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc) was obtained with an independent method solving the

an isochrone fitting of 40-50 Myr. On the other hand, the radial velocity of

conclude that the PN NGC 2452 is not a member of the OC NGC 2453.

the tumor boundaries. To address this issue, we propose a PBNet composed by a
multilevel global perception module (MGPM) and a boundary guided module (BGM)
to segment breast tumors from ultrasound images. Specifically, in MGPM, the
long-range spatial dependence between the voxels in a single level feature maps
are modeled, and then the multilevel semantic information is fused to promote
the recognition ability of the model for non-enhanced tumors. In BGM, the tumor
boundaries are extracted from the high-level semantic maps using the dilation
and erosion effects of max pooling, such boundaries are then used to guide the
fusion of low and high-level features. Moreover, to improve the segmentation
performance for tumor boundaries, a multi-level boundary-enhanced segmentation
(BS) loss is proposed. The extensive comparison experiments on both publicly

outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative

on top of networks with changing architecture over time -- commonly known as

phenomena, which we abbreviate as its `spreading vulnerability', is often
surmised to be related to the topology of the temporal network featured by the
system. Yet, cleanly extracting spreading vulnerability of a complex system
directly from the topological information of the temporal network remains a
challenge. Here, using data from a diverse set of real-world complex systems,
we develop the `entropy of temporal entanglement' as a novel and insightful
quantity to measure topological complexities of temporal networks. We show that
this parameter-free quantity naturally allows for topological comparisons
across vastly different complex systems. Importantly, by simulating three
different types of stochastic dynamical processes playing out on top of
temporal networks, we demonstrate that the entropy of temporal entanglement
serves as a quantitative embodiment of the systems' spreading vulnerability,
irrespective of the details of the processes. In being able to do so, i.e., in
being able to quantitatively extract a complex system's proneness to facilitate
spreading phenomena from topology, this entropic measure opens itself for
applications in a wide variety of natural, social, biological and engineered

collision-free trajectories to avoid obstacles safely and efficiently.
Nonconvex optimization is a popular method to compute a trajectory in

and frequently switch between different local minima, leading to inefficient
and unsafe robot motion. In this work, We propose a novel topology-driven
trajectory optimization strategy for dynamic environments that plans multiple
distinct evasive trajectories to enhance the robot's behavior and efficiency. A
global planner iteratively generates trajectories in distinct homotopy classes.
These trajectories are then optimized by local planners working in parallel.
While each planner shares the same navigation objectives, they are locally
constrained to a specific homotopy class, meaning each local planner attempts a
different evasive maneuver. The robot then executes the feasible trajectory
with the lowest cost in a receding horizon manner. We demonstrate, on a mobile
robot navigating among pedestrians, that our approach leads to faster and safer
trajectories than existing planners.

(ZPLs) from isolated defects in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and compare our
findings with the predictions of a configuration coordinate model involving two
electronic states. Our survey, which spans the spectral range ~550-740 nm,
reveals that, in disagreement with a two-level model, the absorption and
emission dipoles are often misaligned. We relate the dipole misalignment angle
(${\Delta}{\theta}$) to the ZPL Stokes shift (${\Delta}E$) and find that
${\Delta}{\theta}\sim 0{\deg}$ when ${\Delta}E$ corresponds to an allowed h-BN
phonon frequency and that $0{\deg}\leq{\Delta}{\theta}\leq 90{\deg}$ when
${\Delta}E$ exceeds the maximum allowed h-BN phonon frequency. Consequently, a
two-level configuration coordinate model succeeds at describing excitations
mediated by the creation of one optical phonon but fails at describing
excitations that require the creation of multiple phonons. We propose that
direct excitations requiring the creation of multiple phonons are inefficient
due to the low Huang-Rhys factors in h-BN and that these ZPLs are instead
excited indirectly via an intermediate electronic state. This hypothesis is
corroborated by polarization measurements of an individual ZPL excited with two
distinct wavelengths that indicate a single ZPL may be excited by multiple
mechanisms. These findings provide new insight on the nature of the optical
cycle of novel defect-based single photon sources in h-BN.

in enhancing the performance of lane change assistance systems in situations
where downstream bottlenecks restrict the mobility of a few lanes. Building off
of prior work on modeling lane change incentives, we design a controller that
1) encourages automated vehicles to subvert lanes in which distant downstream
delays are likely to occur, while also 2) ignoring greedy local incentives when
such delays are needed to maintain a specific route. Numerical results on
different traffic conditions and penetration rates suggest that the model
successfully subverts a significant portion of delays brought about by
downstream bottlenecks, both globally and from the perspective of the

5$\sigma$), optical (m$_{\rm r}$ $\sim$ 26 - 27.7 at 5$\sigma$), and near-IR

the two fields we identify a total of nine confirmed and ten candidate IFRSs.
We find that our IFRSs are high-redshift radio-loud AGN, with 12/19 sources
having redshift estimates in the range of $z$ $\sim$ 1.7 - 4.3, while a limit
of $z$ $\geq$ 2.0 is placed for the remaining seven sources. Notably, our study

as challenges for global development. As the number of migrants (e.g.,
refugees) increases rapidly in recent years, a key challenge faced by each
country is the problem of migrant resettlement. This problem has attracted
scientific research attention, from the perspective of maximizing the
employment rate. Previous works mainly formulated migrant resettlement as an
approximately submodular optimization problem subject to multiple matroid
constraints and employed the greedy algorithm, whose performance, however, may
be limited due to its greedy nature. In this paper, we propose a new framework
MR-EMO based on Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, which reformulates
Migrant Resettlement as a bi-objective optimization problem that maximizes the
expected number of employed migrants and minimizes the number of dispatched
migrants simultaneously, and employs a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm
(MOEA) to solve the bi-objective problem. We implement MR-EMO using three
MOEAs, the popular NSGA-II, MOEA/D as well as the theoretically grounded GSEMO.
To further improve the performance of MR-EMO, we propose a specific MOEA,
called GSEMO-SR, using matrix-swap mutation and repair mechanism, which has a
better ability to search for feasible solutions. We prove that MR-EMO using
either GSEMO or GSEMO-SR can achieve better theoretical guarantees than the
previous greedy algorithm. Experimental results under the interview and
coordination migration models clearly show the superiority of MR-EMO (with
either NSGA-II, MOEA/D, GSEMO or GSEMO-SR) over previous algorithms, and that
using GSEMO-SR leads to the best performance of MR-EMO.

scalar turbulent/turbulent interface (TTI) has been recently studied in
axisymmetric jets (Kohan & Gaskin, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 950, 2022, A32). The
present study aims to understand the process of turbulent entrainment into a
jet, as affected by background turbulence, using scalar statistics.
Planar-laser-induced fluorescence was employed to capture the orthogonal cross
sections of the jet at a fixed downstream station with varying background
turbulence intensities and length scales. The conditional scalar profiles
revealed that the thickness of the scalar TTI is greater than that of the
traditional turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI), and the interfacial
thickness is an increasing function of the background turbulence intensity.
Although nibbling remains the primary entrainment mechanism in the far field,
increased occurrence of concentration 'holes' within the interfacial layer in
the presence of ambient turbulence suggests a more significant role of
large-scale engulfment in the turbulent/turbulent entrainment process. Enhanced
contribution of the area of detached jet patches (i.e. 'islands') to that of
the main jet is hypothesized to be evidence of intense detrainment events in
the background turbulence. This can potentially explain the reduced net
entrainment into the jet, which manifests as less negative values of scalar
skewness within the jet core.

developmental programs for controllers within these permissive body plans. This
exposes a previously unknown detail about the Baldwin effect: instead of all
useful traits becoming genetically assimilated, only traits that render the
agent robust to changes in other traits become assimilated. We refer to this as
differential canalization. This finding also has implications for the
evolutionary design of artificial and embodied agents such as robots: robots
robust to internal changes in their controllers may also be robust to external
changes in their environment, such as transferal from simulation to reality or
deployment in novel environments.

the classical Barenblatt double-porosity model. For numerical solution of
double-porosity poroelasticity problems we construct splitting schemes with
respect to physical processes, where transition to a new time level is
associated with solving separate problem for the displacements and fluid
pressures in pores and fractures. The stability of schemes is achieved by
switching to three-level explicit-implicit difference scheme with some of the
terms in the system of equations taken from the lower time level and by
choosing a weight parameter used as a regularization parameter. The
computational algorithm is based on the finite element approximation in space.
The investigation of stability of splitting schemes is based on the general
stability (well-posedness) theory of operator-difference schemes. A priori
estimates for proposed splitting schemes and the standard two-level scheme are
provided. The accuracy and stability of considered schemes are demonstrated by
numerical experiments.

the anti-hierarchical quenching of star-formation in large galaxies, consistent
with current observations. At redshifts prior to the formation of large AGN,
galaxy formation is hierarchical and follows the growth of dark-matter halos.

analysis of the Fourier series may provide an alternative, complementary
approach.
  We study Fourier spectra from reflected light curves for geometrically simple
configurations. Depending on its atmospheric properties, a rotating planet in
the habitable zone could have circular polar ice caps. Tidally locked planets,
on the other hand, may have symmetric circular oceans facing the star. These
cases are interesting because the high-albedo contrast at the sharp edges of
the ice-sheets and the glint from the host star in the ocean may produce
recognizable light curves with orbital periodicity, which could also be
interpreted in the Fourier domain.
  We derive a simple general expression for the Fourier coefficients of a
quasiperiodic light curve in terms of the albedo map of a Lambertian planet
surface. Analytic expressions for light curves and their spectra are calculated
for idealized situations, and dependence of spectral peaks on the key

accuracy to numerical solutions. A one-dimensional disordered discrete
nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation and a post-Newtonian Hamiltonian system of
spinning compact binaries are taken as our two examples. We demonstrate
numerically that the proposed algorithm exhibits good long-term performance in
the preservation of energy, if roundoff errors are neglected. This result is
independent of time steps, initial orbital eccentricities, and regular and
chaotic orbital dynamical behavior. In particular, the application of
appropriately large time steps to the new algorithm is helpful in reducing
time-consuming and roundoff errors. This new method, combined with fast
Lyapunov indicators, is well suited related to chaos in the two example

one of the parameters. In the latter problem, a combination of small initial
separations and high initial eccentricities can easily induce chaos.

attenuation and star formation rate. This relation is broadly consistent with
that previously seen in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 0.1. Finally, we
investigate the metallicity via the N2 ratio, finding that z ~ 1 IR-selected

inspection and testing approach, and presents a preliminary case study aiming
at verifying a study design for evaluating the approach. First results from
this preliminary case study indicate that synergies resulting from the
integration of inspection and testing might exist, and show a trend that
testing activities could be guided based on inspection results.

of photographs are uploaded to the internet. We can trivially collect a huge
number of photo streams for various goals, such as image clustering, 3D scene
reconstruction, and other big data applications. However, such tasks are not

Fur-thermore, with the occlusion of unexpected objects like people, vehicles,
it is even more challenging to find feature correspondences and reconstruct
re-alistic scenes. In this paper, we propose a structure-based image completion
algorithm for object removal that produces visually plausible content with
consistent structure and scene texture. We use an edge matching technique to
infer the potential structure of the unknown region. Driven by the estimated
structure, texture synthesis is performed automatically along the estimated
curves. We evaluate the proposed method on different types of images: from
highly structured indoor environment to natural scenes. Our experimental
results demonstrate satisfactory performance that can be potentially used for
subsequent big data processing, such as image localization, object retrieval,
and scene reconstruction. Our experiments show that this approach achieves
favorable results that outperform existing state-of-the-art techniques.

proton partial lifetimes because proton decay mediated by colored Higgsinos
(dimension-five proton decay) is too rapid. In this paper, we pursue the
possibility that a texture of the Yukawa coupling matrices in a renormalizable
SUSY $SO(10)$ GUT model suppresses dimension-five proton decay. We focus on a
general renormalizable SUSY $SO(10)$ GUT model which contains ${\bf 10}+{\bf
126}+{\bf \overline{126}}+{\bf 120}$ representation fields and where the Yukawa
coupling matrices of the ${\bf 16}$ matter fields with the ${\bf 10}$, ${\bf
\overline{126}}$, ${\bf 120}$ fields, $Y_{10},Y_{126},Y_{120}$, provide the
quark and lepton Yukawa couplings and Majorana mass of the singlet neutrinos.
We find that if components in certain flavor bases, $(Y_{10})_{u_R d_R}$,
$(Y_{126})_{u_R d_R}$, $(Y_{10})_{u_R s_R}$, $(Y_{126})_{u_R s_R}$,

the order of the up quark Yukawa coupling, dimension-five proton decay can be
suppressed while the Yukawa coupling matrices still reproduce the realistic
quark and lepton masses and flavor mixings. We numerically obtain specific
Yukawa coupling matrices satisfying the above conditions, calculate proton
partial lifetimes from them and evaluate how dimension-five proton decay is
suppressed when these conditions are met.

applied on the distorted data at the receiver. In this contribution we propose
a novel spatio-temporal error concealment algorithm, the Content-Adaptive
Motion Compensated Frequency Selective Extrapolation. The algorithm operates in
two stages, whereas at first the motion in a distorted sequence is estimated.
After that, a model of the signal is generated for concealing the distortion.
The novel algorithm is based on an already existent error concealment
algorithm. But by adapting the model generation to the content of a sequence,
the novel algorithm is able to exploit the remaining information, which is
still available in the distorted sequence, more effectively compared to the
original algorithm. In doing so, a visually noticeable gain of up to 0.51 dB
PSNR compared to the underlying algorithm and more than 3 dB compared to other
error concealment algorithms can be achieved.

In this approach, the potential difference applied across the gap between two
adjacent GEMs is reversed compared to the standard configuration. In such a gap
structure, called Electric Gate, a signal transfer from the first to second GEM
is presumably provided by the small residual field still existing at small gate
voltages and connecting the holes of the two GEMs. On the other hand, ion
backflow between the GEMs turned out to be substantially reduced. We also
consider another configuration, called Photoelectric Gate, in which in addition
to the Electric Gate configuration, a CsI photocathode is deposited on the
second GEM. In the Photoelectric Gate, ion backflow through the gap is fully
suppressed and the signal transfer through the gap is provided by the
photoelectric mechanism due to either avalanche scintillations in the first GEM
or proportional scintillations in the electroluminescence gap replacing the
first GEM. The idea of the Electric Gate might find applications in the field
of TPC detectors and gas photomultipliers. The idea of the Photoelectric Gate
is more relevant in the field of two-phase avalanche detectors.

predicted lattice distortion was largely controlled by the choice of single
particle orbitals used to construct the wave function, rather than by
subsequent wave function optimization techniques within QMC. However, the
absolute magnetic moment was remarkably insensitive to the method of wave
function construction. QMC estimates of total spin density indicate that in
addition to strong electronic correlation of the Fe $3d$ states, charge
transfer may be an important but challenging piece of physics to accurately
capture within existing QMC methods. Finally, we highlight the need for

two main components; view-consistency cross-attention learns the visual
correspondences to align the local details of view features, and global
semantic conditioning aligns the semantic structure of generated views with the
reference view. Experimental results demonstrate that the NVS-Adapter can

A-star Vega, as observed by the IUE satellite at a resolution comparable to the
star's rotational broadening width, can be fit remarkably well by a
single-temperature synthetic spectrum based on LTE atmosphere models and a
newly constructed UV line list. If Vega were a normal, equator-on,
slow-rotating star, then its spectrum and our analysis would indicate a
temperature of Teff ~ 9550 K, surface gravity of log g ~ 3.7, general surface
metallicity of [m/H] ~ -0.5, and a microturbulence velocity of v(turb) ~ 2.0
km/s. Given its rapid rotation and nearly pole-on orientation, however, these
parameters must be regarded as representing averages across the observed
hemisphere. Modeling the complex UV line spectrum has allowed us to determine
the specific surface abundances for 17 different chemical elements, including
CNO, the light metals, and the iron group elements. The resultant abundance
pattern agrees in general with previous results, although there is considerable
scatter in the literature. Despite its peculiarities, Vega has turned out to
provide a powerful test of the extent of our abilities to model the atmospheric
properties of the early A-stars, particularly the detailed UV line spectrum.
The value of the measurements from this pilot study will increase as this
analysis is extended to more objects in the rich high-dispersion IUE data
archive, including both normal and peculiar objects.

expansion history of the Universe and cosmological structure formation. Robust
cluster mass determinations are a key ingredient for a reliable measurement of
this evolution, especially at high redshift. Weak gravitational lensing is a
promising tool for, on average, unbiased mass estimates. This weak lensing
project aims at measuring reliable weak lensing masses for a complete X-ray
selected sample of 36 high redshift (0.35<z<0.9) clusters. The goal of this
paper is to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology against commonly
encountered problems, including pure instrumental effects, the presence of
bright (8--9 mag) stars close to the cluster centre, ground based measurements
of high-z (z~0.8) clusters, and the presence of massive unrelated structures
along the line-sight. We select a subsample of seven clusters observed with
MMT/Megacam. Instrumental effects are checked in detail by cross-comparison
with an archival CFHT/MegaCam observation. We derive mass estimates for seven
clusters by modelling the tangential shear with an NFW profile, in two cases
with multiple components to account for projected structures in the
line-of-sight. We firmly detect lensing signals from all seven clusters at more
than $3.5\sigma$ and determine their masses, ranging from $10^{14} M_{\odot}$
to $10^{15} M_{\odot}$, despite the presence of nearby bright stars. We
retrieve the lensing signal of more than one cluster in the CL 1701+6414 field,
while apparently observing CL 1701+6414 through a massive foreground filament.
We also find a multi-peaked shear signal in CL 1641+4001. Shear structures
measured in the MMT and CFHT images of CL 1701+6414 are highly correlated.

(GCS), capable of handling multimodal time-lapse data and controlling CO2
injectivity to mitigate reservoir fracturing risks. In GCS, DT represents
virtual replicas of subsurface systems that incorporate real-time data and
advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) techniques, including
neural posterior density estimation via simulation-based inference and
sequential Bayesian inference. These methods enable the effective monitoring
and control of CO2 storage projects, addressing challenges such as subsurface
complexity, operational optimization, and risk mitigation. By integrating
diverse monitoring data, e.g., geophysical well observations and imaged
seismic, DT can bridge the gaps between seemingly distinct fields like
geophysics and reservoir engineering. In addition, the recent advancements in
genAI also facilitate DT with principled uncertainty quantification. Through
recursive training and inference, DT utilizes simulated current state samples,
e.g., CO2 saturation, paired with corresponding geophysical field observations
to train its neural networks and enable posterior sampling upon receiving new
field data. However, it lacks decision-making and control capabilities, which
is necessary for full DT functionality. This study aims to demonstrate how DT
can inform decision-making processes to prevent risks such as cap rock
fracturing during CO2 storage operations.

die who might otherwise live if the sale of organs was permitted. But there is
no guarantee that permitting organ sales would effectively address the current
supply-side shortage and global use of the black market. In addition to
discussing the implications of these procurement systems, I look at methods to
increase organ donations and I explore the differences between presumed and

bolstered by the addition of a policy of presumed consent and appropriate
financial incentives, is a better choice than a legal sales market in spite of

ground-based Cherenkov telescopes of the Imaging class with the aim of
exploring the highest energy region of the electromagnetic spectrum. With two
planned arrays, one for each hemisphere, it will guarantee a good sky coverage
in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV, with improved
angular resolution and a sensitivity in the TeV energy region better by one
order of magnitude than the currently operating arrays. In order to cover this
wide energy range, three different telescope types are envisaged, with
different mirror sizes and focal plane features. In particular, for the highest
energies a possible design is a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder optical
scheme, with a compact focal plane. A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) based
camera is being proposed as a solution to match the dimensions of the pixel
(angular size of ~ 0.17 degrees). INFN is developing a camera demonstrator made
by 9 Photo Sensor Modules (PSMs, 64 pixels each, with total coverage 1/4 of the
focal plane) equipped with FBK (Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy) Near

Target 7 ASIC, a 16 channels fast sampler (up to 2GS/s) with deep buffer,
self-trigger and on-demand digitization capabilities specifically developed for
this purpose. The pixel dimensions of $6\times6$ mm$^2$ lead to a very compact
design with challenging problems of thermal dissipation. A modular structure,
made by copper frames hosting one PSM and the corresponding FEE, has been
conceived, with a water cooling system to keep the required working
temperature. The actual design, the adopted technical solutions and the
achieved results for this demonstrator are presented and discussed.

a Kerr background by means of numerical and analytical methods. Our main focus
is on the behaviour of the solutions near spacelike infinity, which is
appropriately represented as a cylinder. Earlier studies of the wave equation
on a Schwarzschild background have revealed important details about the
regularity of the corresponding solutions. It was found that, on the cylinder,
the solutions generically develop logarithmic singularities at infinitely many
orders. Moreover, these singularities also `spread' to future null infinity.
However, by imposing certain regularity conditions on the initial data, the
lowest-order singularities can be removed. Here we are interested in a
generalisation of these results to a rotating black hole background and study
the influence of the rotation rate on the properties of the solutions. To this
aim, we first construct a conformal compactification of the Kerr solution which
yields a suitable representation of the cylinder at spatial infinity. Besides
analytical investigations on the cylinder, we numerically solve the wave
equation with a fully pseudospectral method, which allows us to obtain highly
accurate numerical solutions. This is crucial for a detailed analysis of the
regularity of the solutions. In the Schwarzschild case, the numerical problem
could effectively be reduced to solving $(1+1)$-dimensional equations. Here we
present a code that can perform the full $2+1$ evolution as required for
axisymmetric waves on a Kerr background.

emerges as a pivotal methodology for transferring advanced capabilities from
leading proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, to their open-source counterparts like

crucial role in both compressing these models, and facilitating their
self-improvement by employing themselves as teachers. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting its
critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and its
utility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is meticulously
structured around three foundational pillars: \textit{algorithm},
\textit{skill}, and \textit{verticalization} -- providing a comprehensive
examination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities,
and their practical implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the survey
navigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation (DA) and KD,
illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful paradigm within the KD framework to
bolster LLMs' performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich,
skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enabling
open-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment,
and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts.
This work aims to provide an insightful guide for researchers and
practitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in KD and
proposing future research directions. Importantly, we firmly advocate for

are F_{4(4)}, E_{6(2)}, E_{7(-5)}, E_{8(-24)} and SO(n+2,4). Our formulation is

quasiconformal realizations of all these groups twisted by a unitary character.
We also give their quadratic Casimir operators and determine their values. Our
work lays the algebraic groundwork for constructing the unitary representations
of these groups induced by their geometric quasiconformal actions, which
include the quaternionic discrete series. For rank 2 cases, SU(2,1) and
G_{2(2)}, corresponding to simple N=2 supergravity in four and five dimensions,
this program was carried out in arXiv:0707.1669. We also discuss the

are equipped with multiple antennas. The basic problem is to design optimal
linear transceivers (or beamformers) that can maximize system throughput. The
recent work [1] suggests that optimal beamformers should maximize the total
degrees of freedom and achieve interference alignment in high SNR. In this
paper we first consider the interference alignment problem in spatial domain
and prove that the problem of maximizing the total degrees of freedom for a
given MIMO interference channel is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that even
checking the achievability of a given tuple of degrees of freedom for all
receivers is NP-hard when each receiver is equipped with at least three
antennas. Interestingly, the same problem becomes polynomial time solvable when
each transmit/receive node is equipped with no more than two antennas. Finally,
we propose a distributed algorithm for transmit covariance matrix design, while
assuming each receiver uses a linear MMSE beamformer. The simulation results
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing interference
alignment algorithms in terms of system throughput.

popular due to its practical simplicity. However, the severe nonlinearity and
non-convexity make the related optimization problem mathematically difficult to
solve, especially when the transmit power or the path-loss exponent (PLE) is
unknown. Moreover, even if the PLE is known but not perfectly estimated or the
anchor location information is not accurate, the constructed data model will
become uncertain, making the problem again hard to solve. This paper
particularly focuses on differential received signal strength (DRSS)-based
localization with model uncertainties in case of unknown transmit power and
PLE. A new whitened model for DRSS-based localization with unknown transmit
powers is first presented and investigated. When assuming the PLE is known, we
introduce two estimators based on an exact data model, an advanced best linear
unbiased estimator (A-BLUE) and a Lagrangian estimator (LE), and then we
present a robust semidefinite programming (SDP)-based estimator (RSDPE), which
can cope with model uncertainties (imperfect PLE and inaccurate anchor location
information). The three proposed estimators have their own advantages from
different perspectives: the A-BLUE has the lowest complexity; the LE holds the
best accuracy for a small measurement noise; and the RSDPE yields the best
performance under a large measurement noise and possesses a very good
robustness against model uncertainties. Finally, we propose a robust SDP-based
block coordinate descent estimator (RSDP-BCDE) to deal with a completely
unknown PLE and its performance converges to that of the RSDPE using a
perfectly known PLE.

generation of wireless communication network. To meet the growing demands in
massive connectivity and huge data in transmission, a novel index modulation
aided NOMA with the rotation of signal constellation of low power users
(IM-NOMA-RC) is developed to the downlink transmission. In the proposed
IM-NOMA-RC system, the users are classified into far-user group and near-user
group according to their channel conditions, where the rotation constellation
based IM operation is performed only on the users who belong to the near-user
group that are allocated lower power compared with the far ones to transmit
extra information. In the proposed IM-NOMA-RC, all the subcarriers are
activated to transmit information to multiple users to achieve higher SE. With
the aid of the multiple dimension modulation in IM-NOMA-RC, more users can be
supported over an orthogonal resource block. Then, both maximum likelihood (ML)

for all the user. Numerical simulation results of the proposed IM-NOMARC scheme

have been made in supervised object detection, its unsupervised counterpart
remains largely unexplored. With the growth of data volume, the expensive cost
of annotations is the major limitation hindering further study. Therefore,
discovering objects without annotations has great significance. However, this
task seems impractical on still-image or point cloud alone due to the lack of
discriminative information. Previous studies underlook the crucial temporal
information and constraints naturally behind multi-modal inputs. In this paper,
we propose 4D unsupervised object discovery, jointly discovering objects from
4D data -- 3D point clouds and 2D RGB images with temporal information. We
present the first practical approach for this task by proposing a ClusterNet on
3D point clouds, which is jointly iteratively optimized with a 2D localization
network. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset suggest
that the localization network and ClusterNet achieve competitive performance on
both class-agnostic 2D object detection and 3D instance segmentation, bridging
the gap between unsupervised methods and full supervised ones. Codes and models

Lyrae covering an unprecedented fraction ($\sim60\%$) of the volume of the
Galactic inner halo ($\text{R}<28$ kpc). We study the morphology of the stellar
halo by analysing the RR Lyrae distribution with parametric and non-parametric
techniques. Taking advantage of the uniform all-sky coverage, we test halo
models more sophisticated than usually considered in the literature, such as
those with varying flattening, tilt and/or offset of the halo with respect to
the Galactic disc. A consistent picture emerges: the inner halo is well
reproduced by a smooth distribution of stars settled on triaxial ellipsoids.
The minor axis is perpendicular to the Milky Ways disc, while the major axis is
misaligned by $\sim20^{\circ}$ from the Galactic Y axis. The elongation along
the major axis is mild ($\text{p}=1.27$), and the vertical flattening is shown
to evolve from a squashed state with $\text{q}\approx0.57$ in the centre to a
more spherical $\text{q}\approx0.75$ at the outer edge of our dataset. The
density slope is well approximated by a single power-law with exponent
$\alpha=-2.96$. Within the range probed, we see no significant evidence for a

paper shows how a two-parameter classification of massive-star magnetospheres
in terms of the magnetic wind confinement (which sets the Alfv\'en radius RA)
and stellar rotation (which sets the Kepler co-rotation radius RK) provides a
useful organisation of both observational signatures and theoretical
predictions. We compile the first comprehensive study of inferred and observed
values for relevant stellar and magnetic parameters of 64 confirmed magnetic OB
stars with Teff > 16 kK. Using these parameters, we locate the stars in the
magnetic confinement-rotation diagram, a log-log plot of RK vs. RA. This
diagram can be subdivided into regimes of centrifugal magnetospheres (CM), with
RA > RK, vs. dynamical magnetospheres (DM), with RK > RA. We show how key
observational diagnostics, like the presence and characteristics of Halpha
emission, depend on a star's position within the diagram, as well as other
parameters, especially the expected wind mass-loss rates. In particular, we
identify two distinct populations of magnetic stars with Halpha emission:
namely, slowly rotating O-type stars with narrow emission consistent with a DM,
and more rapidly rotating B-type stars with broader emission associated with a
CM. For O-type stars, the high mass-loss rates are sufficient to accumulate
enough material for line emission even within the relatively short free-fall
timescale associated with a DM: this high mass-loss rate also leads to a rapid
magnetic spindown of the stellar rotation. For the B-type stars, the longer
confinement of a CM is required to accumulate sufficient emitting material from
their relatively weak winds, which also lead to much longer spindown
timescales. [abbreviated]

Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) sample plus archival data from the
Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our main result is
that these mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominant
power source. The combination of a high ionization line index and PAH strength
serves as an efficient discriminant between AGN and star-forming nuclei,
confirming progress made with ISO spectroscopy on starbursting and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The sensitivity of Spitzer allows us to probe
fainter nuclei and star-forming regions within galaxy disks. We find that both
star-forming nuclei and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that are
powered by Seyfert or LINER activity. In fact, we identify areas within four
diagnostic diagrams containing >90% Seyfert/LINER nuclei or >90% HII
regions/HII nuclei. We also find that, compared to starbursting nuclei,
extranuclear regions typically separate even further from AGN, especially for
low-metallicity extranuclear environments. In addition, instead of the
traditional mid-infrared approach to differentiating between AGN and
star-forming sources that utilizes relatively weak high-ionization lines, we
show that strong low-ionization cooling lines of X-ray dominated regions like
[SiII] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.
Finally, the typical target in this sample shows relatively modest interstellar
electron density (~400 cm^{-3}) and obscuration (A_V ~ 1.0 mag for a foreground
screen), consistent with a lack of dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dust
residing in the emitting regions. [Abridged]

particles and power high-energy emission in various astrophysical systems.
Whereas most previous studies focused on relativistic reconnection in pair
plasmas, less attention has been paid to electron-ion plasma reconnection,
expected in black hole accretion flows and relativistic jets. We report a
comprehensive particle-in-cell numerical investigation of reconnection in an
electron-ion plasma, spanning a wide range of ambient ion magnetizations
$\sigma_i$, from the semirelativistic regime (ultrarelativistic electrons but
nonrelativistic ions, 0.001<<$\sigma_i$<<1) to the fully relativistic regime
(both species are ultrarelativistic, $\sigma_i$>>1). We investigate how the
reconnection rate, electron and ion plasma flows, electric and magnetic field
structures, electron/ion energy partitioning, and nonthermal particle
acceleration depend on $\sigma_i$. Our key findings are: (1) the reconnection
rate is about 0.1 of the Alfvenic rate across all regimes; (2) electrons can
form concentrated moderately relativistic outflows even in the
semirelativistic, small-$\sigma_i$ regime; (3) while the released magnetic
energy is partitioned equally between electrons and ions in the
ultrarelativistic limit, the electron energy fraction declines gradually with
decreased $\sigma_i$ and asymptotes to about 0.25 in the semirelativistic
regime; (4) reconnection leads to efficient nonthermal electron acceleration
with a $\sigma_i$-dependent power-law index, $p(\sigma_i) \simeq $const$+0.7
{\sigma_i}^{-1/2}$. These findings are important for understanding black hole
systems and lend support to semirelativistic reconnection models for powering
nonthermal emission in blazar jets, offering a natural explanation for the
spectral indices observed in these systems.

given natural language expression. Typically, referring expressions contain
complex relationships between the target and its surrounding objects. The main
challenge of this task is to understand the visual and linguistic content
simultaneously and to find the referred object accurately among all instances
in the image. Currently, the most effective way to solve the above problem is
to obtain aligned multi-modal features by computing the correlation between
visual and linguistic feature modalities under the supervision of the
ground-truth mask. However, existing paradigms have difficulty in thoroughly
understanding visual and linguistic content due to the inability to perceive
information directly about surrounding objects that refer to the target. This
prevents them from learning aligned multi-modal features, which leads to
inaccurate segmentation. To address this issue, we present a position-aware
contrastive alignment network (PCAN) to enhance the alignment of multi-modal
features by guiding the interaction between vision and language through prior
position information. Our PCAN consists of two modules: 1) Position Aware
Module (PAM), which provides position information of all objects related to
natural language descriptions, and 2) Contrastive Language Understanding Module
(CLUM), which enhances multi-modal alignment by comparing the features of the
referred object with those of related objects. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate our PCAN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

sufficiently many measurements on a jet or other restricted phase space region.
Resummation is accomplished by renormalization group evolution of the objects
in the factorization theorem and anomalous dimensions can be calculated to any
perturbative accuracy and with any number of colors. To connect with the NGLs
of more inclusive measurements, we present a novel perturbative expansion which
is controlled by the volume of the allowed phase space for unresolved
emissions. Arbitrary accuracy can be obtained by making more and more
measurements so to resolve lower and lower scales. We find that even a minimal
number of measurements produces agreement with Monte Carlo methods for
leading-logarithmic resummation of NGLs at the sub-percent level over the full
dynamical range relevant for the Large Hadron Collider. We also discuss other

mass insertion parameter spaces, we explore the supersymmetry mass insertion
effects on the branching ratios, the direct CP asymmetries and the polarization
fractions in $B_{s}\to K^{*-}\pi^+, K^{-}\rho^+, K^{*-}\rho^+$ decays. We find
the constrained LR and RL insertions can provide sizable contributions to the
branching ratios of $B_{s}\to K^{*-}\pi^{+}$,$K^{(*)-}\rho^{+}$ as well as the
direct CP asymmetry and the longitudinal polarization of $B_{s}\to
K^{*-}\rho^{+}$ decay without conflict with all related data within $2\sigma$
ranges.
  Near future experiments at Fermi Lab and CERN LHC-b can test our predictions
and shrink/reveal the mass insertion parameter spaces.

proportion of diagnostic exams was calculated. The array without cable weighed
480 grams, demonstrated good flexibility while maintaining element decoupling.
The coil was preferred by all nurses and anesthesiologists involved in the care

23 of 24 exams were diagnostically adequate with 85 percent confidence interval
of 90-100 percent. Light-weight highly flexible coil arrays can be constructed

the multiple-cluster system Abell 901/902. We use data from the STAGES survey
and COMBO-17 to investigate the relation between the color and structural
properties of the dwarfs and their location in the cluster. The definition of
the dwarf sample is based on the central surface brightness and includes
galaxies in the luminosity range -16 >= M_B >~-19 mag. Using a fit to the color
magnitude relation of the dwarfs, our sample is divided into a red and blue
subsample. We find a color-density relation in the projected radial
distribution of the dwarf sample: at the same luminosity dwarfs with redder
colors are located closer to the cluster centers than their bluer counterparts.
Furthermore, the redder dwarfs are on average more compact and rounder than the
bluer dwarfs. These findings are consistent with theoretical expectations
assuming that bright early-type dwarfs are the remnants of transformed
late-type disk galaxies involving processes such as ram pressure stripping and
galaxy harassment. This indicates that a considerable fraction of dwarf
elliptical galaxies in clusters are the results of transformation processes
related to interactions with their host cluster.

geometry, for downlink cellular networks with multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) base stations (BSs). The developed paradigm accounts for signal
retransmission upon decoding errors, in which the temporal correlation among
the signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the original and
retransmitted signals is captured. In addition to modeling the effect of
retransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model
presents twofold analysis unification for MIMO cellular networks literature.
First, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted
(i.e., modulation scheme and receiver type agnostic) outage probability
analysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the
analysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysis is
achieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering
signals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO
representation for the per-data stream SINR in MIMO cellular networks. We show
that the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the
model accuracy. To this end, we discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff
imposed by different MIMO schemes and shed light on the diversity loss due to
the temporal correlation among the SINRs of the original and retransmitted
signals. Finally, several design insights are highlighted.

autonomous driving vehicles. In this work, we focus on the uncertainty in
sensing and perception, resulted from a limited field of view, occlusions, and
sensing range. This problem is often tackled by considering hypothetical hidden
objects in occluded areas or beyond the sensing range to guarantee passive
safety. However, this may result in conservative planning and expensive
computation, particularly when numerous hypothetical objects need to be
considered. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based solution to manage
uncertainty by optimizing for the worst case outcome. This approach is in
contrast to traditional RL, where the agents try to maximize the average
expected reward. The proposed approach is built on top of the Distributional RL
with its policy optimization maximizing the stochastic outcomes' lower bound.
This modification can be applied to a range of RL algorithms. As a
proof-of-concept, the approach is applied to two different RL algorithms, Soft
Actor-Critic and DQN. The approach is evaluated against two challenging
scenarios of pedestrians crossing with occlusion and curved roads with a
limited field of view. The algorithm is trained and evaluated using the SUMO
traffic simulator. The proposed approach yields much better motion planning
behavior compared to conventional RL algorithms and behaves comparably to
humans driving style.

  Classes",,,,,cs.DM,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Nowhere dense classes of graphs are very general classes of uniformly sparse
graphs with several seemingly unrelated characterisations. From an algorithmic
perspective, a characterisation of these classes in terms of uniform
quasi-wideness, a concept originating in finite model theory, has proved to be
particularly useful. Uniform quasi-wideness is used in many fpt-algorithms on
nowhere dense classes. However, the existing constructions showing the
equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform quasi-wideness imply a
non-elementary blow up in the parameter dependence of the fpt-algorithms,
making them infeasible in practice.
  As a first main result of this paper, we use tools from logic, in particular
from a subfield of model theory known as stability theory, to establish
polynomial bounds for the equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform
quasi-wideness.
  A powerful method in parameterized complexity theory is to compute a problem
kernel in a pre-computation step, that is, to reduce the input instance in
polynomial time to a sub-instance of size bounded in the parameter only
(independently of the input graph size). Our new tools allow us to obtain for
every fixed value of $r$ a polynomial kernel for the distance-$r$ dominating
set problem on nowhere dense classes of graphs. This result is particularly
interesting, as it implies that for every class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs which
is closed under subgraphs, the distance-$r$ dominating set problem admits a
kernel on $\mathcal{C}$ for every value of $r$ if, and only if, it admits a
polynomial kernel for every value of $r$ (under the standard assumption of
parameterized complexity theory that $\mathrm{FPT} \neq W[2]$).

precision reaching below $1 \times 10^{-19}$ [arXiv:2109.12238]. Such clock
precision, together with imaging spectroscopy, enables precise control of
collisional shifts as well as the lattice light shift [arXiv:2201.05909,

measure the second order Zeeman coefficient on the least magnetically sensitive

reduce the dynamic black body radiation shift uncertainty. All other systematic

This indicates that EDFinFET based circuits may be less dense. In this study we
show that wide fins enable taller fin heights. The ability to engineer multiple

phenomenon known as the coffee-ring effect. This also occurs when the liquid
contains suspended microbes; evaporation leaves cells at higher concentrations
in the ring than the drop interior. Using biofilm experiments and cellular
automata simulations, we show that the physical structure created by the
coffee-ring effect can dramatically alter the outcome of inter-bacterial
competition. We experimentally study this effect using two strains of
$\textit{Vibrio cholerae}$ that compete using a contact-dependent killing
mechanism termed the type 6 secretion system. By creating a heterogeneous
density profile, the coffee-ring effect changes the outcome of competition: the
bacterial strain that wins in the low-density interior loses in the far denser
ring. Through simulations parameterized with experimentally-determined density
profiles, we recapitulate our experimental findings. We examine the role of a
$\textit{V. cholerae}$ strain's frequency, its relative efficacy at killing
competitors, and the initial concentration of cells in the droplet in
determining the outcome of competition. By scaling from individual cellular
interactions to overall changes in strain frequency, our work demonstrates how
the coffee-ring effect plays a powerful role in structuring microbial
communities, indirectly driving ecological changes in community composition.

$\alpha_d(\omega)$ for their uses in a specially designed trap geometry for
these ions so that they can be used unambiguously among any hyperfine levels of
the atomic states of the clock transitions. We also present $\alpha_d(\omega)$
values explicitly at the 1064 nm for the atomic states associated with the
clock transitions which may be useful for creating ""high-field seeking"" traps

the states would be free from the Stark shifts are also presented. Accurate
values of the electric dipole matrix elements required for these studies are
given and trends of electron correlation effects in determining them are also

because they are compatible with the imaging regime delivering optimal SNR
efficiency. In conventional 3D multi-slab imaging, shot-to-shot phase
variations caused by motion pose challenges due to the use of multi-shot
k-space acquisition. Navigator acquisition after each imaging echo is typically
employed to correct phase variations, which prolongs scan time and increases
the specific absorption rate (SAR). The aim of this study is to develop a
highly efficient, self-navigated method to correct for phase variations in 3D
multi-slab diffusion MRI without explicitly acquiring navigators. The sampling
of each shot is carefully designed to intersect with the central kz plane of
each slab, and the multi-shot sampling is optimized for self-navigation
performance while retaining decent reconstruction quality. The central kz
intersections from all shots are jointly used to reconstruct a 2D phase map for
each shot using a structured low-rank constrained reconstruction that leverages
the redundancy in shot and coil dimensions. The phase maps are used to
eliminate the shot-to-shot phase inconsistency in the final 3D multi-shot
reconstruction. We demonstrate the method's efficacy using retrospective
simulations and prospectively acquired in-vivo experiments at 1.22 mm and 1.09
mm isotropic resolutions. Compared to conventional navigated 3D multi-slab
imaging, the proposed self-navigated method achieves comparable image quality
while shortening the scan time by 31.7% and improving the SNR efficiency by
15.5%. The proposed method produces comparable quality of DTI and white matter
tractography to conventional navigated 3D multi-slab acquisition with a much
shorter scan time.

  Prompt Learning",Accepted by Empirical Software Engineering 2024 (EMSE),,,,cs.SE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  When drafting question posts for Stack Overflow, developers may not
accurately summarize the core problems in the question titles, which can cause
these questions to not get timely help. Therefore, improving the quality of
question titles has attracted the wide attention of researchers. An initial
study aimed to automatically generate the titles by only analyzing the code
snippets in the question body. However, this study ignored the helpful
information in their corresponding problem descriptions. Therefore, we propose
an approach SOTitle+ by considering bi-modal information (i.e., the code
snippets and the problem descriptions) in the question body. Then we formalize
the title generation for different programming languages as separate but
related tasks and utilize multi-task learning to solve these tasks. Later we
fine-tune the pre-trained language model CodeT5 to automatically generate the
titles. Unfortunately, the inconsistent inputs and optimization objectives
between the pre-training task and our investigated task may make fine-tuning
hard to fully explore the knowledge of the pre-trained model. To solve this
issue, SOTitle+ further prompt-tunes CodeT5 with hybrid prompts (i.e., mixture
of hard and soft prompts). To verify the effectiveness of SOTitle+, we
construct a large-scale high-quality corpus from recent data dumps shared by
Stack Overflow. Our corpus includes 179,119 high-quality question posts for six
popular programming languages. Experimental results show that SOTitle+ can
significantly outperform four state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic
evaluation and human evaluation. Our work indicates that considering bi-modal
information and prompt learning in Stack Overflow title generation is a
promising exploration direction.

has been rigorously surveyed, scrutinized, and perceived that the work in this
direction began nearly 44 years ago, with the primitive development of
functional piezoelectric thin-film material, and now there are already three
major companies commercializing them on a bulk scale. This fascinating fact
illustrates the enormous contribution made by more than 70 different centers,
research institutes, and agencies spread across 4 different continents to
develop the vast know-how of these devices design, make, and function. This
review covers such important contributions in a short but comprehensive fashion
and in particular, intends to educate the readers about the global scenario of
PMUTs, the principles governing their design, the ways following their make,
all non-conventional useful PMUT designs, and lastly, category wise
applications. Crucial comparison charts in terms of thin-film piezoelectric
material used in PMUTs, and in terms of targeted applications are also depicted
and discussed, which is believed to enlighten any MEMS designer planning to
begin working with PMUTs. Moreover, each relevant section is provided with a
crisp future forecast, from the authors past knowledge and expertise in this
very field of research along with the elements of a careful literature survey.
In short, this review can be considered a one-stop time-efficient guide for
whoever is interested in knowing about these small devices.

trial evaluating the effect on survival time of CIMAvax-EGF versus best
supportive care were analyzed retrospectively following the causal inference
approach. Pre-treatment potential predictive biomarkers included basal serum
EGF concentration, peripheral blood parameters and immunosenescence biomarkers
(The proportion of CD8 + CD28- T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD4 CD8 ratio
and CD19+ B cells. The 33 patients with complete information were included. The
predictive causal information (PCI) was calculated for all possible models. The
model with a minimum number of predictors, but with high prediction accuracy
(PCI>0.7) was selected. Good, rare and poor responder patients were identified
using the predictive probability of treatment success. Results: The mean of PCI
increased from 0.486, when only one predictor is considered, to 0.98 using the
multivariate approach with all predictors. The model considering the proportion
of CD4+ T cell, basal EGF concentration, NLR, Monocytes, and Neutrophils as
predictors were selected (PCI>0.74). Patients predicted as good responders
according to the pre-treatment biomarkers values treated with CIMAvax-EGF had a
significant higher observed survival compared with the control group (p=0.03).
No difference was observed for bad responders. Conclusions: Peripheral blood

concentration in serum resulted in good predictors of the CIMAvax-EGF success
in advanced NSCLC. The study illustrates the application of a new methodology,

systems, all containing planets on ~ 1 AU orbits. We place bounds on the
locations in the circumbinary protoplanetary disk, where these planets could
have formed through collisional agglomeration starting from small (km-sized or
less) planetesimals. We first present a model of secular planetesimal dynamics
that accounts for the (1) perturbation due to the eccentric precessing binary,
as well as the (2) gravity and (3) gas drag from a precessing eccentric disk.
Their simultaneous action leads to rich dynamics, with (multiple) secular
resonances emerging in the disk. We derive analytic results for size-dependent
planetesimal eccentricity, and demonstrate the key role of the disk gravity for
circumbinary dynamics. We then combine these results with a simple model for
collisional outcomes and find that in systems like Kepler 16, planetesimal
growth starting with 10-100 m planetesimals is possible outside a few AU. The
exact location exterior to which this happens is sensitive to disk
eccentricity, density and precession rate, as well as to the size of the first
generation of planetesimals. Strong perturbations from the binary in the inner
part of the disk, combined with a secular resonance at a few AU inhibit the
growth of km-sized planetesimals within 2 - 4 AU of the binary. In situ
planetesimal growth in the Kepler circumbinary systems is possible only
starting from large (few-km-sized) bodies in a low-mass disk with surface
density less than 500 g/cm^2 at 1 AU.

frequency of measurement data under strict latency constraints introduces new
challenges for real time communication. It would be very helpful if the

existing quality of service (QoS) mechanisms in the communication networks can
be leveraged. To achieve this goal, certain anomaly detection functions should
be conducted by the PMUs. Inspired by the recent emerging edge-fog-cloud

taken during May 4-13, 2010 (when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of
2.3 AU, and an observer distance of 2.0 AU) by the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (Wright et al. 2010). Photometry of the coma at 22 microns and data
from the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope obtained on May 22, 2010 provide
constraints on the dust particle size distribution, dlogn/dlogm, yielding
power-law slope values of alpha = -0.97 +/- 0.10, steeper than that found for
the inbound particle fluence during the Stardust encounter of comet 81P/Wild 2
(Green et al. 2004). The extracted nucleus signal at 12 microns is consistent
with a body of average spherical radius of 0.6 +/- 0.2 km (one standard
deviation), assuming a beaming parameter of 1.2. The 4.6 micron-band signal in
excess of dust and nucleus reflected and thermal contributions may be
attributed to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide emission lines and provides
limits and estimates of species production. Derived carbon dioxide coma
production rates are 3.5(+/- 0.9) \times 10^24 molecules per second. Analyses
of the trail signal present in the stacked image with an effective exposure
time of 158.4 seconds yields optical-depth values near 9 x 10^-10 at a delta
mean anomaly of 0.2 deg trailing the comet nucleus, in both 12 and 22 {\mu}m
bands. A minimum chi-squared analysis of the dust trail position yields a
beta-parameter value of 1.0 x10^-4, consistent with a derived mean trail-grain
diameter of 1.1/{\rho} cm for grains of {\rho} g/cm^3 density. This leads to a
total detected trail mass of at least 4 x 10^10 {\rho} kg.

development of Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) filters for
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, designed to increase the smoothness and
improve the convergence rate of the DG solution through this post-processor.
These advantages can be exploited during flow visualization, for example by
applying the SIAC filter to the DG data before streamline computations [Steffan
{\it et al.}, IEEE-TVCG 14(3): 680-692]. However, introducing these filters in
engineering applications can be challenging since a tensor product filter grows
in support size as the field dimension increases, becoming computationally
expensive. As an alternative, [Walfisch {\it et al.}, JOMP 38(2);164-184]
proposed a univariate filter implemented along the streamline curves. Until
now, this technique remained a numerical experiment. In this paper we introduce
the SIAC line filter and explore how the orientation, structure and filter size
affect the order of accuracy and global errors. We present theoretical error
estimates showing how line filtering preserves the properties of traditional
tensor product filtering, including smoothness and improvement in the
convergence rate. Furthermore, numerical experiments are included, exhibiting
how these filters achieve the same accuracy at significantly lower
computational costs, becoming an attractive tool for the scientific
visualization community.

High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, coupled with modelling based on laboratory

properties along our line of sight towards Galactic X-ray sources. Here, we
focus on the oxygen content of the interstellar medium through its absorption
features in the X-ray spectra. To model the dust features, we perform a
laboratory experiment using the electron microscope facility located at the
University of Cadiz in Spain, where we acquire new laboratory data in the
oxygen K-edge. We study 18 dust samples of silicates and oxides with different
chemical compositions. The laboratory measurements are adopted for our
astronomical data analysis. We carry out a case study on the X-ray spectrum of
the bright low-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-2, observed by XMM-Newton. We
determine different temperature phases of the ISM, and parameterize oxygen in
both gas (neutral and ionised) and dust form. We find Solar abundances of
oxygen along the line of sight towards the source. Due to both the relatively
low depletion of oxygen into dust form and the shape of the oxygen cross
section profiles, it is challenging to determine the precise chemistry of
interstellar dust. However, silicates provide an acceptable fit. Finally, we
discuss the systematic discrepancies in the atomic (gaseous phase) data of the
oxygen edge spectral region using different X-ray atomic databases, and also
consider future prospects for studying the ISM with the Arcus concept mission.

secondary-star models to compare the predicted and the observed emission lines
and to establish the nature of the line-forming regions. Results. Our
observations and data analysis, when combined with models of the irradiated
secondary-star, show that, while the weak low ionization metal lines (FeI and

emission lines, as well as NaI and HeI, cannot be reproduced by the irradiated
secondary-star models. We favor the secondary-star chromospheric activity as

exquisite control in technical ceramics conflicts with commonly used processing
methods. Here, we circumvent this issue by combining the recently developed
Magnetically-Assisted Slip Casting (MASC) technique with the well-established
process of Templated Grain Growth (TGG). MASC enables the local control over
the orientation of platelets dispersed among smaller isotropic particles. After
a high temperature pressure-less treatment, the grains of the final ceramic
follow the same orientation of the initial platelets. This combination allows
us to produce 95 % dense alumina part with a grain orientation following any
deliberate orientation. We successfully fabricated microstructures inspired
from biological materials with ceramics that present periodically varying
patterns with a programmable pitch of a few tens of microns. We confirmed the
capacity of the process to tailor local mechanical properties through local
grains orientation using micro-indentation. This micrometer scale control over
the local mechanical properties could be applied to adapt ceramic structures to
complex loads using this inexpensive and scalable process. In systems where
functional properties also depend on anisotropic grain orientation, the
principle presented here could enable the creation of new multifunctional
ceramics.

Carlo simulations of long gamma-ray burst observations assuming three radial

energising path optimisation based on the minimum cost flow model is
investigated, then an iterative searching method for alternative path schemes
based on mixed integer linear programming is proposed. The iterative method for
alternative path schemes could determine more than one scheme with minimal
charging reactive power efficiently. In order to make a comprehensive
evaluation of the alternative schemes, an evaluation index set is established,
and the method based on similarity to ideal grey relational projection is
introduced to achieve the final evaluation. The New England 10-unit 39-bus
system and the southern Hebei power system of China are employed to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method can provide more
efficient and comprehensive decision support for the dispatchers to select
reasonable energising paths.

the occurrence time of an event that might impact the market model somehow. By

we describe the random time models for which these structure conditions are

capture more information than scalar value functions in the value network. One
of the most well-known methods in this branch is distributional RL, which
models return distribution instead of scalar value. In another line of work,
hybrid reward architectures (HRA) in RL have studied to model source-specific
value functions for each source of reward, which is also shown to be beneficial
in performance. To fully inherit the benefits of distributional RL and hybrid
reward architectures, we introduce Multi-Dimensional Distributional DQN
(MD3QN), which extends distributional RL to model the joint return distribution
from multiple reward sources. As a by-product of joint distribution modeling,
MD3QN can capture not only the randomness in returns for each source of reward,
but also the rich reward correlation between the randomness of different
sources. We prove the convergence for the joint distributional Bellman operator
and build our empirical algorithm by minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy
between joint return distribution and its Bellman target. In experiments, our
method accurately models the joint return distribution in environments with
richly correlated reward functions, and outperforms previous RL methods
utilizing multi-dimensional reward functions in the control setting.

is the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation between the density of interstellar gas
and the rate at which that gas forms stars. A tight correlation between these
quantities has long been measured at galactic scales. More recently, using
surveys of YSOs, a KS relationship has been found within molecular clouds
relating the surface density of star formation to the surface density of gas;
however, the scaling of these laws varies significantly from cloud to cloud. In
this Letter, we use a recently developed, high-accuracy catalog of young
stellar objects from $\textit{Spitzer}$ combined with high-dynamic-range gas
column density maps of twelve nearby ($<$1.5 kpc) molecular clouds from
$\textit{Herschel}$ to re-examine the KS relation within individual molecular
clouds. We find a tight, linear correlation between clouds' star formation rate
per unit area and their gas surface density normalized by the gas free-fall
time. The measured intracloud KS relation, which relates star formation rate to
the volume density, extends over more than two orders of magnitude within each
cloud and is nearly identical in each of the twelve clouds, implying a constant
star formation efficiency per free-fall time $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\approx 0.026$.
The finding of a universal correlation within individual molecular clouds,
including clouds that contain no massive stars or massive stellar feedback,
favors models in which star formation is regulated by local processes such as
turbulence or stellar feedback such as protostellar outflows, and disfavors
models in which star formation is regulated only by galaxy properties or
supernova feedback on galactic scales.

In fact, all known solutions are coupled to specific properties of the
Hamiltonian and may be divided into two categories: One class consists of
time-dependent Hamiltonians which are not higher than quadratic in the position
operator, like i.e the driven harmonic oscillator with time-dependent
frequency. The second class is related to the existence of additional
invariants in the Hamiltonian, which can be used to map the solution of the
time-dependent problem to that of a related time-independent one.
  In this article we discuss and develop analytic methods for solving
time-dependent tunneling problems, which cannot be addressed by using quadratic
Hamiltonians. Specifically, we give an analytic solution to the problem of
tunneling from an attractive time-dependent potential which is embedded in a
long-range repulsive potential.
  Recent progress in atomic physics makes it possible to observe experimentally
time-dependent phenomena and record the probability distribution over a long
range of time. Of special interest is the observation of macroscopical

system, our bonded BNA (BNA-sapphire) generates 2.5 times higher electric field
strengths compared to bare BNA crystals. We characterize the average damage
threshold for bare BNA and BNA-sapphire, measure peak-to-peak electric field
strengths and THz waveforms, and determine the nonlinear transmission in BNA.
Pumping BNA-sapphire with 800-nm light results in peak-to-peak electric fields
exceeding 1 MV/cm, with strong broadband frequency components from 0.5-5 THz.
Our BNA-sapphire THz source is a promising alternative to tilted pulse front
LiNbO3 THz sources, which will enable many research groups without optical
parametric amplifiers to perform high-field, broadband THz spectroscopy.

evolving, there is a general consensus in the psychology, science and
engineering communities that the evolution toward players' behaviors in
interactive decision-making problems will be accompanied by the exploitation of
their empathy, sympathy, compassion, antipathy, spitefulness, selfishness,
altruism, and self-abnegating states in the payoffs. In this article, we study
one-shot bimatrix games from a psychological game theory viewpoint. A new
empathetic payoff model is calculated to fit empirical observations and both
pure and mixed equilibria are investigated. For a realized empathy structure,
the bimatrix game is categorized among four generic class of games. Number of
interesting results are derived. A notable level of involvement can be observed
in the empathetic one-shot game compared the non-empathetic one and this holds
even for games with dominated strategies. Partial altruism can help in breaking
symmetry, in reducing payoff-inequality and in selecting social welfare and
more efficient outcomes. By contrast, partial spite and self-abnegating may
worsen payoff equity. Empathetic evolutionary game dynamics are introduced to
capture the resulting empathetic evolutionarily stable strategies under wide
range of revision protocols including Brown-von Neumann-Nash, Smith, imitation,
replicator, and hybrid dynamics. Finally, mutual support and Berge solution are
investigated and their connection with empathetic preferences are established.
We show that pure altruism is logically inconsistent, only by balancing it with
some partial selfishness does it create a consistent psychology.

  Open-Source LLMs in Their Ability to Label Chest X-Ray Reports",,,,,cs.CL cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,"  Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there
have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models. While recent
publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information
of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison
of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.
  Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used. The
first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the
Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. The second
dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. We then
compared the commercial models GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the
open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B,
QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately
label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different
prompting techniques.
  Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was
Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot
prompts, respectively. GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984,
respectively. On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source
model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and
few-shot prompting, respectively. GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and
0.973, respectively.
  Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to
open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot
prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4. This shows that
open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to
GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.

random finite groups by drawing random Mealy automata. In this paper we show
that, for a special class of Mealy automata that generate only finite groups,
the distribution is far from being uniform since the obtained groups are

rigorously study physical systems. The mathematical models used to probe these

prohibitively many simulations for acceptable accuracy. Surrogate models
provide a means of circumventing the high computational expense of sampling
such complex models. In particular, polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) have
been successfully used for uncertainty quantification studies of deterministic
models where the dominant source of uncertainty is parametric. We discuss an
extension to conventional PCE surrogate modeling to enable surrogate
construction for stochastic computational models that have intrinsic noise in
addition to parametric uncertainty. We develop a PCE surrogate on a joint space
of intrinsic and parametric uncertainty, enabled by Rosenblatt transformations,
and then extend the construction to random field data via the Karhunen-Loeve
expansion. We then take advantage of closed-form solutions for computing PCE
Sobol indices to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model which
quantifies the intrinsic noise contribution to the overall model output
variance. Additionally, the resulting joint PCE is generative in the sense that
it allows generating random realizations at any input parameter setting that
are statistically approximately equivalent to realizations from the underlying
stochastic model. The method is demonstrated on a chemical catalysis example
model.

rate of solar spots is directly related to magnetic diffusivity, which itself
is a key quantity for the length of a magnetic-activity cycle. Is a linear spot
decay also seen on other stars, and is this in agreement with the large range
of solar and stellar activity cycle lengths? We investigate the evolution of
starspots on the rapidly-rotating ($P_{\rm rot}$ $\approx$ 24 d) K0 giant XX
Tri, using consecutive time-series Doppler images. Our aim is to obtain a
well-sampled movie of the stellar surface over many years, and thereby detect
and quantify a starspot decay law for further comparison with the Sun. We
obtained continuous high-resolution and phase-resolved spectroscopy with the
1.2-m robotic STELLA telescope on Tenerife over six years. For each observing
season, we obtained between 5 to 7 independent Doppler images, one per stellar
rotation, making up a total of 36 maps. To quantify starspot area decay and
growth, we match the observed images with simplified spot models based on a
Monte Carlo approach. It is shown that the surface of XX Tri is covered with
large high-latitude and even polar spots and with occasional small equatorial
spots. Just over the course of six years, we see a systematically changing spot
distribution with various timescales and morphology, such as spot fragmentation
and spot merging as well as spot decay and formation. An average linear decay
of $D$ = $-$0.022 $\pm$ 0.002 SH/day is inferred. We found evidence of an
active longitude in phase toward the (unseen) companion star. Furthermore, we
detect a weak solar-like differential rotation with a surface shear of $\alpha$
= 0.016 $\pm$ 0.003. From the decay rate, we determine a turbulent diffusivity
of $\eta_T$ = (6.3 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ cm$^2$/s and predict a
magnetic activity cycle of $\approx$ 26 $\pm$ 6 years.

$\Delta$ be the Laplace-Beltrami operator on ${\bf M}$. Say $0 \neq f \in
\mathcal{S}(\RR^+)$, and that $f(0) = 0$. For $t > 0$, let $K_t(x,y)$ denote
the kernel of $f(t^2 \Delta)$. Suppose $f$ satisfies Daubechies' criterion, and
$b > 0$. For each $j$, write ${\bf M}$ as a disjoint union of measurable sets
$E_{j,k}$ with diameter at most $ba^j$, and comparable to $ba^j$ if $ba^j$ is
sufficiently small. Take $x_{j,k} \in E_{j,k}$. We then show that the functions
$\phi_{j,k}(x)=[\mu(E_{j,k})]^{1/2} \bar{K_{a^j}}(x_{j,k},x)$ form a frame for
$(I-P)L^2({\bf M})$, for $b$ sufficiently small (here $P$ is the projection
onto the constant functions). Moreover, we show that the ratio of the frame
bounds approaches 1 nearly quadratically as the dilation parameter approaches
1, so that the frame quickly becomes nearly tight (for $b$ sufficiently small).
Moreover, based upon how well-localized a function $F \in (I-P)L^2$ is in space
and in frequency, we can describe which terms in the summation $F \sim SF =
\sum_j \sum_k < F,\phi_{j,k} > \phi_{j,k}$ are so small that they can be
neglected. If $n=2$ and $\bf M$ is the torus or the sphere, and $f(s)=se^{-s}$
(the ""Mexican hat"" situation), we obtain two explicit approximate formulas for
the $\phi_{j,k}$, one to be used when $t$ is large, and one to be used when $t$
is small. Finally we explain in what sense the kernel $K_t(x,y)$ should itself
be regarded as a continuous wavelet on ${\bf M}$, and characterize the H\""older
continuous functions on ${\bf M}$ by the size of their continuous wavelet
transforms, for H\""older exponents strictly between 0 and 1.

attack that is highly transferable. This threat comes from the distribution gap
between adversarial and clean samples in feature space of the target DNNs. In
this paper, we use Deep Generative Networks (DGNs) with a novel training
mechanism to eliminate the distribution gap. The trained DGNs align the
distribution of adversarial samples with clean ones for the target DNNs by
translating pixel values. Different from previous work, we propose a more
effective pixel level training constraint to make this achievable, thus
enhancing robustness on adversarial samples. Further, a class-aware
feature-level constraint is formulated for integrated distribution alignment.
Our approach is general and applicable to multiple tasks, including image
classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. We conduct
extensive experiments on different datasets. Our strategy demonstrates its
unique effectiveness and generality against black-box attacks.

derive the dynamical mass M_dyn of nearby galaxies. Both components become too
faint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In
those cases, the 158 $\mu$m line of atomic carbon [CII] may be the only way to
derive M_dyn. As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the
determination of M_dyn, it is important to quantify the relative distributions
of HI, CO and [CII]. HI and CO are well-characterised observationally, however,
for [CII] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO,
HI, and [CII] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES,
THINGS and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R_25, the average [CII]
exponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much
steeper than the HI distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated
spectrum (""global profile""), where the [CII] spectrum looks more like that of
the CO than that of the HI. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of
integrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the
intrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the
[CII] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [CII] data of a number of star
forming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [CII] linewidths
agree better with those of the CO than the HI. As the radial extent of a given
ISM tracer is a key input in deriving M_dyn from spatially unresolved data, we
conclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining M_dyn based on
[CII] data, is that of the well-characterised CO distribution. This length
scale is similar to that of the optical disk.

remain little understood. Paleomagnetic data primarily constrain the reversal
rate and provide few additional clues. Reversals and excursions are
characterized by a low in dipole moment that can last for some 10kyr. Some
paleomagnetic records also suggest that the field decreases much slower before
an reversals than it recovers afterwards and that the recovery phase may show
an overshoot in field intensity. Here we study the dipole moment variations in
several extremely long dynamo simulation to statistically explored the reversal
and excursion properties. The numerical reversals are characterized by a switch
from a high axial dipole moment state to a low axial dipole moment state. When
analysing the respective transitions we find that decay and growth have very
similar time scales and that there is no overshoot. Other properties are
generally similar to paleomagnetic findings. The dipole moment has to decrease
to about 30% of its mean to allow for reversals. Grand excursions during which
the field intensity drops by a comparable margin are very similar to reversals
and likely have the same internal origin. The simulations suggest that both are
simply triggered by particularly large axial dipole fluctuations while other
field components remain largely unaffected. A model at a particularly large
Ekman number shows a second but little Earth-like type of reversals where the
total field decays and recovers after some time.

  Detector Simulation: A Voyage From Emulation to Extrapolation","PhD thesis, 234 pages",,,,physics.ins-det cs.AI cs.LG hep-ex hep-ph,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Simulating ultra-high-granularity detector responses in Particle Physics
represents a critical yet computationally demanding task. This thesis aims to
overcome this challenge for the Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD) at the Belle II
experiment, which features over 7.5M pixel channels-the highest spatial
resolution detector simulation dataset ever analysed with generative models.
This thesis starts off by a comprehensive and taxonomic review on generative
models for simulating detector signatures. Then, it presents the Intra-Event
Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN), a new geometry-aware generative
model that introduces a relational attentive reasoning and Self-Supervised
Learning to approximate an ""event"" in the detector. This study underscores the
importance of intra-event correlation for downstream physics analyses. Building
upon this, the work drifts towards a more generic approach and presents
YonedaVAE, a Category Theory-inspired generative model that tackles the open
problem of Out-of-Distribution (OOD) simulation. YonedaVAE introduces a
learnable Yoneda embedding to capture the entirety of an event based on its
sensor relationships, formulating a Category theoretical language for
intra-event relational reasoning. This is complemented by introducing a
Self-Supervised learnable prior for VAEs and an Adaptive Top-q sampling
mechanism, enabling the model to sample point clouds with variable
intra-category cardinality in a zero-shot manner. Variable Intra-event
cardinality has not been approached before and is vital for simulating
irregular detector geometries. Trained on an early experiment data, YonedaVAE
can reach a reasonable OOD simulation precision of a later experiment with
almost double luminosity. This study introduces, for the first time, the
results of using deep generative models for ultra-high granularity detector
simulation in Particle Physics.

sequence of weak measurements corresponding to a stochastic process. However,
the weak measurements may require almost arbitrary unitaries, which are
unlikely to be realized by any real measurement device. Furthermore, many
measurement processes are destructive, like photon counting procedures that
terminate once all photons are consumed. One cannot expect to have full control
of the evolution of a state under such destructive measurements, and the
possible unitaries allow only a limited set of weak measurements. In this
paper, we consider a qubit model of destructive weak measurements, which is a
toy version of an optical cavity, in which the state of an electromagnetic
field mode inside the cavity leaks out and is measured destructively while the
vacuum state |0> leaks in to the cavity. At long times, the state of the qubit
inevitably evolves to be |0>, and the only available control is the choice of
measurement on the external ancilla system. Surprisingly, this very limited
model can still perform an arbitrary projective measurement on the qubit in any
basis, where the probability of getting an outcome satisfies the usual Born
rule. Combining this method with probabilistic post processing, the result can
be extended to any generalized measurement with commuting POVM elements. This
implies, among other results, that any two-outcome POVM on a qubit can be
decomposed into a sequence of destructive weak measurements by this restricted
measurement device.

constraints from X-ray observations. Motivated by such a remarkable progress,
we examine the fate of the remnants formed in NS mergers and focus on the roles
of the angular momentum and the mass distribution of the binary NSs. In the
mass shedding limit (for which the dimensionless angular momentum equals to the
Keplerian value, i.e., $j=j_{\rm Kep}$), the adopted { seven EoS models, except
H4 and ALF2,} yield supramassive NSs in more than half of the mergers. However,
for $j\lesssim 0.7j_{\rm Kep}$, the presence or absence of a non-negligible
fraction of supramassive NSs formed in the mergers depends sensitively on both
the EoS and the mass distribution of the binary systems. The NS mergers with a
total gravitational mass $\leq 2.6M_\odot$ are found to be able to shed
valuable light on both the EoS model and the angular momentum of the remnants
if supramassive NSs are still absent. We have also discussed the uncertainty on
estimating the maximum gravitational mass of non-rotating NSs ($M_{\rm max}$)
due to the unknown $j$ of the pre-collapse remnants. With the data of GW170817

scenes. Dynamic NeRFs extend this model by capturing time-varying elements,
typically using deformation fields. The existing dynamic NeRFs employ a similar
Eulerian representation for both light radiance and deformation fields. This
leads to a close coupling of appearance and motion and lacks a physical
interpretation. In this work, we propose Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural
Radiance Field (DAP-NeRF), which introduces particle-based representation to
model the motions of visual elements in a dynamic 3D scene. DAP-NeRF consists
of superposition of a static field and a dynamic field. The dynamic field is
quantised as a collection of {\em appearance particles}, which carries the
visual information of a small dynamic element in the scene and is equipped with
a motion model. All components, including the static field, the visual features
and motion models of the particles, are learned from monocular videos without
any prior geometric knowledge of the scene. We develop an efficient
computational framework for the particle-based model. We also construct a new
dataset to evaluate motion modelling. Experimental results show that DAP-NeRF
is an effective technique to capture not only the appearance but also the
physically meaningful motions in a 3D dynamic scene.

far, KFT has only been able to describe a single type of particles, sufficient
to consider structure growth due to the gravitational interactions between dark
matter. However, the influence of baryonic gas dynamics becomes increasingly
relevant when describing smaller scales. In this paper, we thus demonstrate how
to extend the KFT formalism as well as a previously presented resummation
scheme towards describing such mixtures of two particle species. Thereby, the
gas dynamics of baryons are accounted for using the recently developed model of
Mesoscopic Particle Hydrodynamics. Assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM Universe and a
simplified model for the thermal gas evolution, we demonstrate the validity of
this approach by computing the linear evolution of the individual and total
matter power spectra between the epoch of recombination and today. Our results
correctly reproduce the expected behaviour, showing a suppression of both
baryonic and dark matter structure growth on scales smaller than the baryonic
Jeans length, in good agreement with results from the numerical Boltzmann
solver CLASS. Nonlinear corrections within this approach will be investigated

$[g_{\mu\nu}]=1/[L]^2$. Several other approaches to quantum gravity, including
the model of superplastic vacuum and $BF$-theories of gravity support this
suggesuion. The important consequence of such metric dimension is that all the
diffeomorphism invariant quantities are dimensionless for any dimension of
spacetime. These include the action $S$, interval $s$, cosmological constant
$\Lambda$, scalar curvature $R$, scalar field $\Phi$, etc. Here we are trying
to further exploit the Diakonov idea, and consider the dimension of the Planck
constant. The application of the Diakonov theory suggests that the Planck
constant $\hbar$ is the parameter of the Minkowski metric. The Minkowski
parameter $\hbar$ is invariant only under Lorentz transformations, and is not
diffeomorphism invariant. As a result the Planck constant $\hbar$ has nonzero
dimension -- the dimension of length [L]. Whether this Planck constant length
is related to the Planck length scale, is an open question. In principle there
can be different Minkowski vacua with their own values of the parameter
$\hbar$. Then in the thermal contact between the two vacua their temperatures
obey the analog of the Tolman law: $\hbar_1/T_1= \hbar_2/T_2$.

columns) for the generated SQL query is both crucial and challenging; the
parser is required to connect the natural language (NL) question and the SQL
query to the structured knowledge in the database. We formulate two linking
processes to address this challenge: schema linking which links explicit NL
mentions to the database and structural linking which links the entities in the
output SQL with their structural relationships in the database schema.
Intuitively, the effectiveness of these two linking processes changes based on
the entity being generated, thus we propose to dynamically choose between them
using a gating mechanism. Integrating the proposed method with two graph neural
network-based semantic parsers together with BERT representations demonstrates
substantial gains in parsing accuracy on the challenging Spider dataset.
Analyses show that our proposed method helps to enhance the structure of the
model output when generating complicated SQL queries and offers more
explainable predictions.

learning. He regards mathematical equations as much more trustworthy than
everyday reasoning, and he does not view mathematical equations as expressing
meaning that tractably connects to common sense. For these reasons, he does not
view reconciling between common sense and mathematical formalism as either
necessary or plausible to accomplish. We, however, avoid a potential ""deficit

incorporating multiple, context-dependent epistemological stances into Jim's

productive seeds that instructors could build upon to support Jim's

challenging and demanding. Existing methods solve this problem by performing
subtasks of classification and localization utilizing a shared component (e.g.,
RoI head) in the detector, yet few of them take the distinct preferences of two
subtasks towards feature embedding into consideration. In this paper, we
carefully analyze the characteristics of FSOD, and present that a general
few-shot detector should consider the explicit decomposition of two subtasks,
as well as leveraging information from both of them to enhance feature
representations. To the end, we propose a simple yet effective Adaptive
Fully-Dual Network (AFD-Net). Specifically, we extend Faster R-CNN by
introducing Dual Query Encoder and Dual Attention Generator for separate
feature extraction, and Dual Aggregator for separate model reweighting.
Spontaneously, separate state estimation is achieved by the R-CNN detector.
Besides, for the acquisition of enhanced feature representations, we further
introduce Adaptive Fusion Mechanism to adaptively perform feature fusion in
different subtasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO in various
settings show that, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance by a
large margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization ability.

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process involving $N$ degrees of freedom. The
irreversibility of the process is encoded in the antisymmetric part of the
Onsager matrix. The linearity of the Langevin equations allows us to derive
closed-form expressions in terms of the latter matrix for many quantities of
interest, including the entropy production rate and the fluctuation-dissipation
ratio matrix. This general setting is then illustrated by two classes of
systems. First, we consider the one-dimensional ferromagnetic Gaussian spin
model endowed with a stochastic dynamics where spatial asymmetry results in
irreversibility. The stationary state on a ring is independent of the asymmetry
parameter, whereas it depends continuously on the latter on an open chain. Much
attention is also paid to finite-size effects, especially near the critical
point. Second, we consider arrays of resistively coupled electrical circuits.
The entropy production rate is evaluated in the regime where the local
temperatures of the resistors have small fluctuations. For $RL$ networks the
entropy production rate grows linearly with the size of the array. For $RC$
networks a quadratic growth law violating extensivity is predicted.

representations of undirected networks to achieve an enriched interpretation of
hierarchy that integrates features defining popularity of nodes and similarity
between them, such that the more similar a node is to a less popular neighbor
the higher the hierarchical load of the relationship. The geometric approach
allows us to measure the local contribution of nodes and links to the hierarchy

the similarity filter, able to extract hierarchical backbones containing the
links that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to the
maximum entropy null model for geometric heterogeneous networks. We applied our
geometric approach to the detection of similarity backbones of real networks in
different domains and found that the backbones preserve local topological
features at all scales. Interestingly, we also found that similarity backbones
favor cooperation in evolutionary dynamics modelling social dilemmas.

solution for multioutput regression problems in which the $T$ elements of the
regressors cannot be considered conditionally independent given the
observations. Standard MTGP models assume that there exist both a multitask
covariance matrix as a function of an intertask matrix, and a noise covariance
matrix. These matrices need to be approximated by a low rank simplification of
order $P$ in order to reduce the number of parameters to be learnt from $T^2$
to $TP$. Here we introduce a novel approach that simplifies the multitask
learning by reducing it to a set of conditioned univariate GPs without the need
for any low rank approximations, therefore completely eliminating the
requirement to select an adequate value for hyperparameter $P$. At the same
time, by extending this approach with both a hierarchical and an approximate
model, the proposed extensions are capable of recovering the multitask
covariance and noise matrices after learning only $2T$ parameters, avoiding the
validation of any model hyperparameter and reducing the overall complexity of
the model as well as the risk of overfitting. Experimental results over
synthetic and real problems confirm the advantages of this inference approach
in its ability to accurately recover the original noise and signal matrices, as
well as the achieved performance improvement in comparison to other state of
art MTGP approaches. We have also integrated the model with standard GP
toolboxes, showing that it is computationally competitive with state of the art
options.

called ascent sequences and showed that the ascent sequences of length $n$ are
in one-to-one correspondence with the interval orders, i.e., the posets not
containing the poset $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$. Through the use of generating
functions, this provided an answer to the longstanding open question of
enumerating the (unlabeled) interval orders. A semiorder is an interval order
having a representation in which all intervals have the same length. In terms
of forbidden subposets, the semiorders exclude $\mathbf{2}+\mathbf{2}$ and
$\mathbf{1}+\mathbf{3}$. The number of unlabeled semiorders on $n$ points has
long been known to be the $n$-th Catalan number. However, describing the ascent
sequences that correspond to the semiorders under the bijection of
Bousquet-M\'elou et al. has proved difficult. In this paper, we discuss a major
part of the difficulty in this area: the ascent sequence corresponding to a
semiorder may have an initial subsequence that corresponds to an interval order
that is not a semiorder.
  We define the hereditary semiorders to be those corresponding to an ascent
sequence for which every initial subsequence also corresponds to a semiorder.
We provide a structural result that characterizes the hereditary semiorders and
use this characterization to determine the ordinary generating function for
hereditary semiorders. We also use our characterization of hereditary
semiorders and the characterization of semiorders of dimension 3 given by
Rabinovitch to provide a structural description of the semiorders of dimension
at most 2. From this description, we are able to determine the ordinary
generating for the semiorders of dimension at most 2.

film of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductor with a hole in the film suggests that
charge-$4e$ and charge-$6e$ Cooper pairs may have condensed in this compound.
While exciting, such interpretation calls for a precise determination of the
effective area for the passage of Cooper pairs from one end of the lead to the
other. Unlike the traditional Little-Parks effect where the rim around the hole
is thin, the effective hole area is not obviously defined for the ""thick-rim
geometry"" adopted in [arxiv:2201.10352]. Here, we note that the experiment was
conducted in a regime where the superconctivity is strongly fluctuating, which
motivates an analysis based on the spacetime formulation of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau theory. We argue that under appropriate conditions, the optimal
semi-classical path is not the geometrically shortest one, but the one that
moves along the edge of the hole and takes advantage of the reduced
fluctuations at the boundary of the hole. The condition for the cross-over from
the geometrically shortest path to the path that sticks to the wall is
clarified. In such a scenario, the geometric area of the hole indeed emerges as
the effective area for the flux, providing a theoretical justification to the
interpretation given in [arxiv:2201.10352]. The conclusion of our analysis may
have implication for similar experiments in other superconductors where the
geometry of the device is not obviously that of the Little-Parks experiment
employing the thin wall, but of the thick-rim type such as used in
[arxiv:2201.10352].

substantially improvement of linewidth and extinction ratio. The ring-pair
modulator exhibits a larger linewidth up to 22 GHz, 1.74-time larger than that

experimental results also reveal that the added-up extinction ratio of
ring-pair resonator goes beyond 30 dB, much larger than that in an individual

CLEAN for Fourier-based image reconstruction of hard X-rays flaring sources.
Methods: CLEAN is an iterative deconvolution method for radio and hard X-ray
solar imaging. In a specific step of its pipeline, CLEAN requires the
convolution between an idealized version of the instrumental Point Spread
Function (PSF), and a map collecting point sources located at positions on the
solar disk from where most of the flaring radiation is emitted. This
convolution step has highly heuristic motivations and the shape of the
idealized PSF, which depends on the user's choice, impacts the shape of the
overall reconstruction. Here we propose the use of an
interpolation/extrapolation process to avoid this user-dependent step, and to
realize a completely unbiased version of CLEAN. Results: Applications to
observations recorded by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX)
on-board Solar Orbiter show that this unbiased release of CLEAN outperforms the
standard version of the algorithm in terms of both automation and
reconstruction reliability, with reconstructions whose accuracy is in line with
the one offered by other imaging methods developed in the STIX framework.
Conclusions: This unbiased version of CLEAN proposes a feasible solution to a
well-known open issue concerning CLEAN, i.e., its low degree of automation.
Further, this study provided the first application of an
interpolation/extrapolation approach to image reconstruction from STIX
experimental visibilities.

agents, which casts Bayes-optimality as the implicit solution to a numerical
optimization problem rather than an explicit modeling assumption. Bayes-optimal
agents are risk-neutral, since they solely attune to the expected return, and
ambiguity-neutral, since they act in new situations as if the uncertainty were
known. This is in contrast to risk-sensitive agents, which additionally exploit
the higher-order moments of the return, and ambiguity-sensitive agents, which
act differently when recognizing situations in which they lack knowledge.
Humans are also known to be averse to ambiguity and sensitive to risk in ways
that aren't Bayes-optimal, indicating that such sensitivity can confer
advantages, especially in safety-critical situations. How can we extend the
meta-learning protocol to generate risk- and ambiguity-sensitive agents? The
goal of this work is to fill this gap in the literature by showing that risk-
and ambiguity-sensitivity also emerge as the result of an optimization problem

termination is at the heart of proof theory where it is usually called strong
normalization (of cut elimination). In computer science, termination has always
been an important issue for showing programs correct. In the early days of
logic, strong normalization was usually shown by assigning ordinals to
expressions in such a way that eliminating a cut would yield an expression with
a smaller ordinal. In the early days of verification, computer scientists used
similar ideas, interpreting the arguments of a program call by a natural
number, such as their size. Showing the size of the arguments to decrease for
each recursive call gives a termination proof of the program, which is however
rather weak since it can only yield quite small ordinals. In the sixties, Tait
invented a new method for showing cut elimination of natural deduction, based
on a predicate over the set of terms, such that the membership of an expression
to the predicate implied the strong normalization property for that expression.
The predicate being defined by induction on types, or even as a fixpoint, this
method could yield much larger ordinals. Later generalized by Girard under the
name of reducibility or computability candidates, it showed very effective in
proving the strong normalization property of typed lambda-calculi...

connected in parallel is a challenging problem, especially with cell-to-cell
variations. Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage
analysis (DVA) are effective at the cell level, but a generalizable method to
extend them to module-level SOH estimation remains missing, when only
module-level measurements are available. This paper proposes a new method and
demonstrates that, with multiple features systematically selected from the
module-level ICA and DVA, the module-level SOH can be estimated with high
accuracy and confidence in the presence of cell-to-cell variations. First, an
information theory-based feature selection algorithm is proposed to find an
optimal set of features for module-level SOH estimation. Second, a relevance
vector regression (RVR)-based module-level SOH estimation model is proposed to
provide both point estimates and three-sigma credible intervals while
maintaining model sparsity. With more selected features incorporated, the
proposed method achieves better estimation accuracy and higher confidence at
the expense of higher model complexity. When applied to a large experimental
dataset, the proposed method and the resulting sparse model lead to
module-level SOH estimates with a 0.5% root-mean-square error and a 1.5%
average three-sigma value. With all the training processes completed offboard,
the proposed method has low computational complexity for onboard
implementations.

  around a Young Ultracool Dwarf","AJ, in press",,10.3847/1538-3881/ac8cee,,astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  We present the characterization of the low-gravity M6 dwarf 2MASS J0619-2903
previously identified as an unusual field object based on its strong IR excess
and variable near-IR spectrum. Multiple epochs of low-resolution (R~150)
near-IR spectra show large-amplitude (~0.1-0.5 mag) continuum variations on
timescales of days to 12 years, unlike the small-amplitude variability typical
for field ultracool dwarfs. The variations between epochs are well-modeled as
changes in the relative extinction ($\Delta{A_V}\approx2$ mag). Likewise,
Pan-STARRS optical photometry varies on timescales as long as 11 years (and
possibly as short as an hour) and implies similar amplitude $A_V$ changes.
NEOWISE mid-IR light curves also suggest changes on 6-month timescales, with
amplitudes consistent with the optical/near-IR extinction variations. However,
near-IR spectra, near-IR photometry, and optical photometry obtained in the
past year indicate the source can also be stable on hourly and monthly
timescales. From comparison to objects of similar spectral type, the total
extinction of 2MASS J0619-2903 seems to be $A_V\approx4-6$ mag, with perhaps
epochs of lower extinction. Gaia EDR3 finds that 2MASS J0619-2903 has a
wide-separation (1.2' = 10450 AU) stellar companion, with an isochronal age of
$31^{+22}_{-10}$ Myr and a mass of $0.30^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ Msun. Adopting this
companion's age and EDR3 distance (145.2$\pm$0.6 pc), we estimate a mass of
0.11-0.17 Msun for 2MASS J0619-2903. Altogether, 2MASS J0619-2903 appears to
possess an unusually long-lived primordial circumstellar disk, perhaps making
it a more obscured analog to the ""Peter Pan"" disks found around a few M dwarfs
in nearby young moving groups.

algorithm(AHCOA) to the electromagnetics and antenna community. The ant hill is
built by special species of ants known as formicas ants(also meadow ants, fire
ants and harvester ants). AHCOA is a novel new nature inspired algorithm
mimicking how the ants built and sustain the ant hill for their survival and
sustenance for many years. This problem solves constrained and unconstrained
optimization problems with wide capability in diverse fields. AHCOA is used by
writing equations of volumetric analysis of the ant hill mould the manner in
which the structure is architected. In this paper, we have shown how AHCOA is
better than the previous paper on ant lion optimizer for controlling side lobe
in antenna pattern synthesis in paper [1]. The potential of AHCOA in
synthesizing and analyzing for d/ varying from 1.1,0.6,0.5,0.3 and 0.1 linear
array is also illustrated. Antenna side lobe level minimization is compared
with ant lion optimizer showing why AHCOA is better than the previously
simulated ant lion optimizer for side lobe control. The results show why linear
arrays are better synthesized for AHCOA then other algorithms used in planar
arrays. This paper shows why AHCOA is a strong candidate for antenna
optimization used in linear arrays.

Fermi systems from a large number of exact numerical simulations of the bosonic
sector still poses subtle challenges, especially in the regime of high quantum
degeneracy and in the presence of phase transitions. In this work, we
demonstrate that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), trained on data from
extensive and sign-problem-free numerical simulations of the bosonic sector,
offer a valuable means to infer the thermodynamic properties of Fermi systems.
PINNs can play a particularly crucial role in capturing phase transitions. To
illustrate the methodology of fictitious identical particles combined with
PINNs for simulating the thermodynamics of Fermi systems, we explore its
application in realistic scenarios, including ultracold Fermi gases in periodic
potentials, and phase transitions of pair condensation formed in the unitary
limit in a three-dimensional harmonic trap. For the spatially continuous
Fermi-Hubbard model, we efficiently and reliably simulated hundreds of fermions
here. For the Fermi gas in the unitary limit, based on the fictitious identical
particle combined with PINNs, our approach confirms the universal result of the
critical temperature with the increasing of the number of fermions, and is
consistent with the experimental observations.

background clutter and mutual occlusion, which makes it extremely difficult to
distinguish different individuals across the disjoint camera views. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep self-paced learning (DSPL) algorithm to
alleviate this problem, in which we apply a self-paced constraint and symmetric
regularization to help the relative distance metric training the deep neural
network, so as to learn the stable and discriminative features for person
Re-ID. Firstly, we propose a soft polynomial regularizer term which can derive
the adaptive weights to samples based on both the training loss and model age.
As a result, the high-confidence fidelity samples will be emphasized and the
low-confidence noisy samples will be suppressed at early stage of the whole
training process. Such a learning regime is naturally implemented under a
self-paced learning (SPL) framework, in which samples weights are adaptively
updated based on both model age and sample loss using an alternative
optimization method. Secondly, we introduce a symmetric regularizer term to
revise the asymmetric gradient back-propagation derived by the relative
distance metric, so as to simultaneously minimize the intra-class distance and
maximize the inter-class distance in each triplet unit. Finally, we build a
part-based deep neural network, in which the features of different body parts
are first discriminately learned in the lower convolutional layers and then
fused in the higher fully connected layers. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets have demonstrated the superior performance of our method as compared
with the state-of-the-art approaches.

expand upon Kepler's groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of exoplanets and
astrophysics through new and exciting observations. K2 will use an innovative
way of operating the spacecraft to observe target fields along the ecliptic for
the next 2-3 years. Early science commissioning observations have shown an
estimated photometric precision near 400 ppm in a single 30 minute observation,
and a 6-hour photometric precision of 80 ppm (both at V=12). The K2 mission
offers long-term, simultaneous optical observation of thousands of objects at a
precision far better than is achievable from ground-based telescopes. Ecliptic
fields will be observed for approximately 75-days enabling a unique exoplanet
survey which fills the gaps in duration and sensitivity between the Kepler and
TESS missions, and offers pre-launch exoplanet target identification for JWST
transit spectroscopy. Astrophysics observations with K2 will include studies of
young open clusters, bright stars, galaxies, supernovae, and asteroseismology.

driving and robots to understand their surroundings accurately and robustly. A
multitude of methods exist within this domain, including point-based,
range-image-based, polar-coordinate-based, and hybrid strategies. Among these,
range-image-based techniques have gained widespread adoption in practical
applications due to their efficiency. However, they face a significant
challenge known as the ``many-to-one'' problem caused by the range image's
limited horizontal and vertical angular resolution. As a result, around 20% of
the 3D points can be occluded. In this paper, we present TFNet, a
range-image-based LiDAR semantic segmentation method that utilizes temporal
information to address this issue. Specifically, we incorporate a temporal
fusion layer to extract useful information from previous scans and integrate it
with the current scan. We then design a max-voting-based post-processing
technique to correct false predictions, particularly those caused by the
``many-to-one'' issue. We evaluated the approach on two benchmarks and
demonstrated that the plug-in post-processing technique is generic and can be
applied to various networks.

walks on networks, known as \emph{mixing}, finds widespread applications in
several areas of quantum information and computation. Of particular interest in
most of these applications, is the minimum time beyond which the instantaneous
probability distribution of the quantum walk remains close to this limiting
distribution, known as the \emph{quantum mixing time}. However this quantity is
only known for a handful of specific networks. In this letter, we prove an
upper bound on the quantum mixing time for \emph{almost all networks}, i.e.\
the fraction of networks for which our bound holds, goes to one in the
asymptotic limit. To this end, using several results in random matrix theory,
we find the quantum mixing time of Erd\""os-Renyi random networks: networks of
$n$ nodes where each edge exists with probability $p$ independently. For
example for dense random networks, where $p$ is a constant, we show that the
quantum mixing time is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\right)$. Besides
opening avenues for the analytical study of quantum dynamics on random
networks, our work could find applications beyond quantum information
processing. Owing to the universality of Wigner random matrices, our results on
the spectral properties of random graphs hold for general classes of random
matrices that are ubiquitous in several areas of physics. In particular, our
results could lead to novel insights into the equilibration times of isolated
quantum systems defined by random Hamiltonians, a foundational problem in
quantum statistical mechanics.

the body-fixed frame of a uniformly rotating asteroid is discussed in the
framework of the full spacecraft dynamics, in which the spacecraft is modeled
as a rigid body with the gravitational orbit-attitude coupling. In this
hovering model, both the position and attitude of the spacecraft are kept to be
stationary in the asteroid body-fixed frame. A Hamiltonian structure-based
feedback control law is proposed to stabilize the relative equilibria of the
full dynamics to achieve the orbit-attitude hovering. The control law is
consisted of two parts: potential shaping and energy dissipation. The potential
shaping is to make the relative equilibrium a minimum of the modified
Hamiltonian on the invariant manifold by modifying the potential artificially.
With the energy-Casimir method, it is shown that the unstable relative
equilibrium can always be stabilized in the Lyapunov sense by the potential
shaping with sufficiently large feedback gains. Then the energy dissipation
leads the motion to converge asymptotically to the minimum of the modified
Hamiltonian on the invariant manifold, i.e., the relative equilibrium. The
feasibility of the proposed stabilization control law is validated through
numerical simulations in the case of a spacecraft orbiting around a small
asteroid. The main advantage of the proposed hovering control law is that it is
very simple and is easy to implement autonomously by the spacecraft with little
computation. This advantage is attributed to the utilization of dynamical
behaviors of the system in the control design.

  Quality Object Detection""",,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In object detection, the intersection over union (IoU) threshold is
frequently used to define positives/negatives. The threshold used to train a
detector defines its \textit{quality}. While the commonly used threshold of 0.5
leads to noisy (low-quality) detections, detection performance frequently
degrades for larger thresholds. This paradox of high-quality detection has two
causes: 1) overfitting, due to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds,
and 2) inference-time quality mismatch between detector and test hypotheses. A
multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN, composed of a
sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed to
address these problems. The detectors are trained sequentially, using the
output of a detector as training set for the next. This resampling
progressively improves hypotheses quality, guaranteeing a positive training set
of equivalent size for all detectors and minimizing overfitting. The same
cascade is applied at inference, to eliminate quality mismatches between
hypotheses and detectors. An implementation of the Cascade R-CNN without bells
or whistles achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset, and
significantly improves high-quality detection on generic and specific object
detection datasets, including VOC, KITTI, CityPerson, and WiderFace. Finally,

improvements over the Mask R-CNN. To facilitate future research, two

planetary formation, when embryo-sized objects dominate the inner region of the
system, asteroids are also present and can provide additional material for
objects inside the habitable zone (hereafter HZ). In this study, we make a
comparison of several binary star systems and their efficiency to move icy
asteroids from beyond the snow-line into orbits crossing the HZ. We modeled a
belt of 10000 asteroids (remnants from the late phase of planetary formation
process) beyond the snow-line. The planetesimals are placed randomly around the
primary star and move under the gravitational influence of the two stars and a
gas giant. As the planetesimals do not interact with each other, we divided the
belt into 100 subrings which were separately integrated. In this statistical
study, several double star configurations with a G-type star as primary are
investigated. Our results show that small bodies also participate in bearing a
non-negligible amount of water to the HZ. The proximity of a companion moving
on an eccentric orbit increases the flux of asteroids to the HZ, which could
result into a more efficient water transport on a short timescale, causing a
heavy bombardment. In contrast to asteroids moving under the gravitational
perturbations of one G-type star and a gas giant, we show that the presence of

feedback instability, however we show that they arise in numerical experiments
in which the instability is excluded. A new interpretation is proposed in which
strong ionospheric depletion and associated current broadening (a nonlinear
steepening/wavebreaking process) form magnetosphere-ionosphere waves inside a
downward current region and these oscillations drive upgoing inertial Alfv\'en
waves in the overlying plasma. The resulting waves are governed by
characteristic periods, which are a good match to previously observed periods
for reasonable assumed conditions. Meanwhile, wavelengths perpendicular to the
magnetic field initially map to an ionospheric scale comparable to the electron
inertial length for the low-altitude magnetosphere, but become shorter with
time due to frequency-based phase mixing of boundary waves (a new manifestation
of phase mixing). Under suitable conditions, these could act as seeds for the
ionospheric feedback instability.

timescales, ranging in behaviour from cyclic to stochastic. The changing
strength and geometry of the magnetic field should modify the efficiency of
angular momentum loss by stellar winds, but this has not been well quantified.
In Finley et al. (2018) we investigated the variability of the Sun, and
calculated the time-varying angular momentum loss rate in the solar wind. In
this work, we focus on four low-mass stars that have all had their surface
magnetic fields mapped for multiple epochs. Using mass loss rates determined
from astrospheric Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption, in conjunction with scaling
relations from the MHD simulations of Finley & Matt (2018), we calculate the
torque applied to each star by their magnetised stellar winds. The variability
of the braking torque can be significant. For example, the largest torque for
$\epsilon$ Eri is twice its decadal averaged value. This variation is
comparable to that observed in the solar wind, when sparsely sampled. On
average, the torques in our sample range from 0.5-1.5 times their average
value. We compare these results to the torques of Matt et al. (2015), which use
observed stellar rotation rates to infer the long-time averaged torque on
stars. We find that our stellar wind torques are systematically lower than the
long-time average values, by a factor of ~3-30. Stellar wind variability
appears unable to resolve this discrepancy, implying that there remain some
problems with observed wind parameters, stellar wind models, or the long-term
evolution models, which have yet to be understood.

1d Heisenberg spin-1/2 XXZ chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
and a transverse magnetic field using quantum information measures. Both
longitudinal and transverse DM vectors are considered. Using numerical DMRG, we
compute the one-tangle, two-spin concurrence and the Wigner-Yananse-skew
information. We show that a longitudinal DMI destroys the factorizability
property while a transverse DMI preserves it. We relate the absence of
factorizability to the breaking of the $U(1)$ rotation symmetry about the local
magnetization axis at each lattice site. Physically, breaking of the symmetry
manifests in the existence of a chiral current. Although the longitudinal DMI
destroys factorizability, we obtain a `pseudofactorizing' field ($h_{pf}$) at
which entanglement and hence violation of the $U(1)$ symmetry is minimal. Our
calculations indicate a phase coherent ground state at $h_{pf}$. An
entanglement transition (ET) occurs across this field which is characterized by
an enhanced but finite range of two-spin concurrence in its vicinity in
contrast with the diverging range of the concurrence for the ET across the
factorizing field ($h_{f}$). We relate the asymmetry to the `frameness' or the
ability for the state to act as a reference frame for some measurement. In
absence of longitudinal DMI (or in presence of transverse DMI), at $h_{f}$, the
single site magnetization axis specifies the common $z$-axis for the full
system but not the full Cartesian reference frame due to a lack of phase
reference. On the other hand, in the presence of a longitudinal DMI, our
results indicate that at $h_{pf}$, the local magnetization and the chiral
current are sufficient to specify the full Cartesian reference frame, with the
chiral current being the macroscopic quantity to determine the phase reference.

enhance the capacity of wireless communication systems via passive reflect
beamforming. However, the product path loss limits its performance gains.
Fully-connected (FC) active RIS, which integrates reflect-type power amplifiers
into the RIS elements, has been recently introduced in response to this issue.
Also, sub-connected (SC) active RIS and hybrid FC-active/passive RIS variants,
which employ a limited number of reflect-type power amplifiers, have been
proposed to provide energy savings. Nevertheless, their flexibility in
balancing diverse capacity requirements and power consumption constraints is
limited. In this direction, this study introduces novel hybrid RIS structures,
wherein at least one reflecting sub-surface (RS) adopts the SC-active RIS
design. The asymptotic signal-to-noise-ratio of the FC-active/passive and the
proposed hybrid RIS variants is analyzed in a single-user single-input
single-output setup. Furthermore, the transmit and RIS beamforming weights are
jointly optimized in each scenario to maximize the energy efficiency of a
hybrid RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink system
subject to the power consumption constraints of the base station and the active
RSs. Numerical simulation and analytic results highlight the performance gains
of the proposed RIS designs over benchmarks, unveil non-trivial trade-offs, and

(pertaining to short demographic timescales) and annealed (pertaining to long

EN on the dynamics of isolated and competing populations. We reveal the
emergence of a novel intermediate phase that lies between the quenched and
annealed regimes. Within this phase, dynamics are primarily driven by rare, yet
not exceedingly rare, long periods of almost-steady environmental conditions.
For an isolated population, the time to extinction in this phase exhibits a

the distinct spin-orbital states of the Ru2+ ions (in addition to the common
Ni+ S=1/2 state but with a different orbital state): the Ru2+ S=0 state in
LaSr3NiRuO4H4, but the Ru2+ S=1 state in LaSrNiRuO4. The Ru2+ S=0 state has the
(xy)2(xz; yz)4 occupation due to the RuH4O2 octahedral coordination, and then
the nonmagnetic Ru2+ ions dilute the S=1/2 Ni+ sublattice which consequently
has a very weak antiferromagnetic (AF) superexchange and thus accounts for no
presence of magnetic order down to 1.8 K in LaSr3NiRuO4H4. In strong contrast,
the Ru2+ S=1 state in LaSrNiRuO4 has the (3z2-r2)2(xz; yz)3(xy)1 occupation due
to the planar square RuO4 coordination, and then the multi-orbital FM
superexchange between the S=1/2 Ni+ and S=1 Ru2+ ions gives rise to the high TC
in LaSrNiRuO4. This work highlights the importance of spin-orbital states in
determining the distinct magnetism.

  https://github.com/AaltoPML/node-BNN-covariate-shift",,,,stat.ML cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) promise improved generalization under
covariate shift by providing principled probabilistic representations of
epistemic uncertainty. However, weight-based BNNs often struggle with high
computational complexity of large-scale architectures and datasets. Node-based
BNNs have recently been introduced as scalable alternatives, which induce
epistemic uncertainty by multiplying each hidden node with latent random
variables, while learning a point-estimate of the weights. In this paper, we
interpret these latent noise variables as implicit representations of simple
and domain-agnostic data perturbations during training, producing BNNs that
perform well under covariate shift due to input corruptions. We observe that
the diversity of the implicit corruptions depends on the entropy of the latent
variables, and propose a straightforward approach to increase the entropy of
these variables during training. We evaluate the method on out-of-distribution
image classification benchmarks, and show improved uncertainty estimation of
node-based BNNs under covariate shift due to input perturbations. As a side
effect, the method also provides robustness against noisy training labels.

Further, rich context information is utilized in various policy representation

on the situation a preferable method can be identified. Several numerical
results are presented to illustrate the relative merits of the two methods. Our
calculations of relaxed atomic structures and their conductance properties are
based on density functional theory without introducing adjustable parameters.
Two specific models of disorder are considered: Un-passivated, surface
reconstructed SiNWs are perturbed by random on-site (Anderson) disorder whereas
defects in hydrogen passivated wires are introduced by randomly removed H
atoms. The un-passivated wires are very sensitive to disorder in the surface
whereas bulk disorder has almost no influence. For the passivated wires, the
scattering by the hydrogen vacancies is strongly energy dependent and for
relatively long SiNWs (L>200 nm) the resistance changes from the Ohmic to the
localization regime within a 0.1 eV shift of the Fermi energy. This high
sensitivity might be used for sensor applications.

excelling especially in galaxies. When formulated as a modified gravity theory,
it leads to the so called external field effect (EFE). In the case of the solar
system this means that bodies orbiting the Sun are influenced, beyond its tidal
effect, by the external gravitational field of the Galaxy with magnitude
$\sim2\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ and time-varying direction. Aphelia of
intermediate outer Oort cloud (OC) comets ($30<X<60,~X\equiv
10^{6}/a[\text{au}]$, where $a$ is semimajor axis) are distributed
non-uniformly on the celestial sphere, showing an apparent concentration around
a great circle centered at Galactic longitudes $L=-45$ and 135 deg. Such
non-uniformity is beyond that attributable to the classical injectors of
comets, stellar encounters and the Galactic tides, as well as the expected
observational biases. We investigated a hypothesis that the great circle
concentration of aphelia is a consequence of the long-term action of EFE in the
framework of MD. We considered exclusively quasi-linear MOND (QUMOND) theory.
We built our model of the OC in MD on an analytical approximation of the QUMOND
potential for a point mass in the dominant external field of constant
magnitude. The model is well applicable at heliocentric distances
$r\gtrsim10~000$ au. Constraints on the strength of EFE found by the analysis
of the Cassini radio-tracking data were taken into account. We demonstrated
characteristic imprint of the EFE on the distribution of aphelia of candidate
outer OC comets that migrated down to $r=10~000$ au. By both analytical and
numerical calculations, we showed that the combined effect of EFE and the
Galactic tides could qualitatively account for the characteristic features seen
in the observed distribution of aphelia of the outer OC comets.

try to solve problems of multiDOF humanoids and human-robot interactions. This
paper presents a simple posture control concept from neuroscience, called
disturbance estimation and compensation, DEC concept [1]. It provides
human-like mechanical compliance due to low loop gain, tolerance of time
delays, and automatic adjustment to changes in external disturbance scenarios.
Its outstanding feature is that it uses feedback of multisensory disturbance
estimates rather than 'raw' sensory signals for disturbance compensation. After
proof-of-principle tests in 1 and 2 DOF posture control robots, we present here
a generalized DEC control module for multi-DOF robots. In the control layout,
one DEC module controls one DOF (modular control architecture). Modules of
neighboring joints are synergistically interconnected using vestibular
information in combination with joint angle and torque signals. These sensory
interconnections allow each module to control the kinematics of the more distal
links as if they were a single link. This modular design makes the complexity
of the robot control scale linearly with the DOFs and error robustness high
compared to monolithic control architectures. The presented concept uses
Matlab/Simulink (The MathWorks, Natick, USA) for both, model simulation and
robot control and will be available as open library

proved to be a robust method that can separate the AP signature from the
redshift space distortion (RSD) effect, and deliver powerful cosmological
constraints using the $\lesssim 40h^{-1}\ \rm Mpc$ clustering region. In
previous works, the tomographic AP method was performed via the anisotropic
2-point correlation function statistic. In this work we consider the
feasibility of conducting the analysis in the Fourier domain and examine the
pros and cons of this approach. We use the integrated galaxy power spectrum
(PS) as a function of direction, $\hat P_{\Delta k}(\mu)$, to quantify the
magnitude of anisotropy in the large-scale structure clustering, and use its
redshift variation to do the AP test. The method is tested on the large, high
resolution Big-MultiDark Planck (BigMD) simulation at redshifts $z=0-1$, using
the underlying true cosmology $\Omega_m=0.3071,\ w=-1$. Testing the redshift
evolution of $\hat P_{\Delta k}(\mu)$ in the true cosmology and cosmologies
deviating from the truth with $\delta \Omega_m=0.1,\ \delta w=0.3$, we find
that the redshift evolution of the AP distortion overwhelms the effects created
by the RSD by a factor of $\sim1.7-3.6$. We test the method in the range of
$k\in(0.2,1.8)\ h\ \rm Mpc^{-1}$, and find that it works well throughout the
entire regime. We tune the halo mass within the range $2\times 10^{13}$ to
$10^{14}\ M_{\odot}$, and find that the change of halo bias results in
$\lesssim 5 \%$ change in $\hat P_{\Delta k}(\mu)$, which is less significant
compared with the cosmological effect. Our work shows that it is feasible to
conduct the tomographic AP analysis in the Fourier space.

ferromagnetic instability. The paramagnon theory predicts that the damping term
should have the form $\Omega/\Gamma (q)$ with $\Gamma (q) \propto q$ (the
Landau damping). However, the experiments on uranium metallic compounds UGe$_2$
and UCoGe showed that $\Gamma (q)$ tends to a constant value at vanishing $q$.
A non-zero $\Gamma (0)$ is impossible in systems with one type of carriers
(either localized or itinerant) because it would violate the spin conservation.
It has been conjectured recently that a non-zero $\Gamma (q)$ in UGe$_2$ and
UCoGe may be due to the presence of both localized and itinerant electrons in
these materials, with ferromagnetism involving predominantly localized spins.
We present microscopic analysis of the damping of near-critical localized
excitations due to interaction with itinerant carriers. We show explicitly how
the presence of two types of electrons breaks the cancellation between the
contributions to $\Gamma (0)$ from self-energy and vertex correction insertions
into the spin polarization bubble and discuss the special role of the
Aslamazov-Larkin processes. We show that $\Gamma (0)$ increases with $T$ both

disadvantage in reasoning over more general graph-structured data where nodes
represent entities and edges represent relations between entities. To address
this shortcoming, we generalize transformer attention to consider and update
edge vectors in each transformer layer. We evaluate this relational transformer
on a diverse array of graph-structured tasks, including the large and
challenging CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. There, it dramatically
outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks expressly designed to reason
over graph-structured data. Our analysis demonstrates that these gains are
attributable to relational attention's inherent ability to leverage the greater

rate (SFR) of a galaxy and the luminosity of its brightest star-cluster (SFR
vs. M$_{V}^{brightest}$). We first show that the observed trend between SFR vs.
M$_{V}^{brightest}$ is due to the brightest cluster in a galaxy being
preferentially young (<15 Myr - for a constant SFR) and hence a good tracer of
the current SFR, although we give notable exceptions to this rule. Using a
series of Monte Carlo simulations we show that a pure power-law mass function
with index, alpha=2, is ruled out by the current data. Instead we find that a
Schechter function (i.e. a power-law with an exponential truncation at the high
mass end) provides an excellent fit to the data. Additionally, these
simulations show that bound cluster formation (in Msun/yr) represents only
~8+-3% of the total star-formation within a galaxy, independent of the
star-formation rate. From this we conclude that there is only a single mode of
cluster formation which operates over at least six orders of magnitude in the
SFR. Using this relation, we can extrapolate backwards in time in order to
estimate the peak SFR of major merger galaxies, such as NGC7252, NGC1316 and
NGC3610. The derived SFRs for these galaxies are between a few hundred and a
few thousand solar masses per year. The inferred far infrared luminosity of the
galaxies, from the extrapolated SFR, places them well within the range of
Ultra-luminous galaxies (ULIRGs) and for NGC 7252 within the Hyper-luminous
infrared galaxy regime. Thus, we provide evidence that these post merger
galaxies passed through a ULIRG/HLIRG phase and are now evolving passively.
Using the current and extrapolated past SFR of NGC 34, we infer that the ULIRG
phase of this galaxy has lasted for at least 150 Myr.

This new tool brings together a variety of capabilities we have developed over
the past few years (including video synchronization and geolocation to order
unstructured videos lacking metadata over time and space, and sound recognition
algorithms) to enable the reconstruction and analysis of events captured on
video. Among other uses, VERA enables the localization of a shooter from just a

this suite of tools, we present the results of estimating the shooter's
location of the Las Vegas Shooting in 2017 and show that VERA accurately
predicts the shooter's location using only the first few gunshots. We then
point out future directions that can help improve the system and further reduce
unnecessary human labor in the process. All of the components of VERA run
through a web interface that enables human-in-the-loop verification to ensure

Donut-shaped vortex nanosecond laser pulses, carrying two vortices with
opposite handedness, were demonstrated to produce two chiral nanojets twisted

move from atom to atom in the crystals. Based on the LBs, anharmonic

demonstrate our theory, we study the thermal transport in an atomic chain with
a temperature drop applied on the two ends of the chain. We observe a Rabi-like
oscillation in the transport of the LBs, from which we define the thermal
current to get the thermal conductivity of the chain. Results show that the
thermal conductivity is enhanced slowly with the increasing of the anharmonic

planet formation, which assume unperturbed evolution of the host star and its
planets. However, in star clusters the interactions with flyby stars and
binaries may be relatively common during the lifetime of a planetary system.
Here, via high-resolution $N$-body simulations of star-planet systems perturbed
by interlopers (stars and binaries), we explore the reconfiguration to the
planetary system due to the encounters. In particular, via an exploration
focused on the strong scattering regime, we derive the fraction of encounters
which result in planet ejections, planet transfers and collisions by the
interloper star/binary, as a function of the characteristics of the environment
(density, velocity dispersion), and for different masses of the flyby
star/binary. We find that binary interlopers can significantly increase the
cross section of planet ejections and collisions, while they only slightly
change the cross section for planet transfers. Therefore, in environments with
high binary fractions, floating planets are expected to be relatively common,
while in environments with low binary fractions, where the cross sections of
planet ejection and transfer are comparable, the rate of planet exchanges
between two stars will be comparable to the rate of production of free-floating
planets.

interstellar medium (ISM) physics on Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiation transfer and
to quantify how galaxy orientation with respect to the line of sight alters
observational signatures. Methods. We compare the results of Lya radiation
transfer calculations through the ISM of a couple of idealized galaxy
simulations with different ISM models. Results. First, the small-scale
structuration of the ISM plays a determinant role in shaping a galaxys Lya
properties.The artificially warm, and hence smooth, ISM of G1 yields an escape
fraction of 50 percent at the Lya line center, and produces symmetrical
double-peak profiles. On the contrary, in G2, most young stars are embedded in
thick star-forming clouds, and the result is a 10 times lower escape fraction.
G2 also displays a stronger outflowing velocity field, which favors the escape
of red-shifted photons, resulting in an asymmetric Lya line. Second, the Lya
properties of G2 strongly depend on the inclination at which it is observed:
From edge-on to face-on, the line goes from a double-peak profile with an
equivalent width of -5 Angstrom to a 15 times more luminous red-shifted
asymmetric line with EW 90 Angstrom. Conclusions. Lya radiation transfer
calculations can only lead to realistic properties in simulations where
galaxies are resolved into giant molecular clouds, putting these calculations
out of reach of current large scale cosmological simulations. Finally, we find
inclination effects to be much stronger for Lya photons than for continuum
radiation. This could potentially introduce severe biases in the selection
function of narrow-band Lya emitter surveys, which could indeed miss a
significant fraction of the high-z galaxy population.

1709.04418,Anders Bredahl Kock,Anders Bredahl Kock and David Preinerstorfer,Power in High-Dimensional Testing Problems,27 pages,,,,math.ST stat.TH,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Fan et al. (2015) recently introduced a remarkable method for increasing
asymptotic power of tests in high-dimensional testing problems. If applicable
to a given test, their power enhancement principle leads to an improved test
that has the same asymptotic size, uniformly non-inferior asymptotic power, and
is consistent against a strictly broader range of alternatives than the
initially given test. We study under which conditions this method can be
applied and show the following: In asymptotic regimes where the dimensionality
of the parameter space is fixed as sample size increases, there often exist
tests that can not be further improved with the power enhancement principle.
However, when the dimensionality of the parameter space increases sufficiently
slowly with sample size and a marginal local asymptotic normality (LAN)
condition is satisfied, every test with asymptotic size smaller than one can be
improved with the power enhancement principle. While the marginal LAN condition
alone does not allow one to extend the latter statement to all rates at which
the dimensionality increases with sample size, we give sufficient conditions
under which this is the case.

provably robust to a given amount of noise. However, despite only enforcing a
single robustness criterion, its performance scales poorly with dataset
complexity. On CIFAR10, a non-robust LeNet model has a 21.63% error rate, while
a model created using verifiable training and a L-infinity robustness criterion
of 8/255, has an error rate of 57.10%. Upon examination, we find that when
labeling visually similar classes, the model's error rate is as high as 61.65%.
We attribute the loss in performance to inter-class similarity. Similar classes
(i.e., close in the feature space) increase the difficulty of learning a robust
model. While it's desirable to train a robust model for a large robustness
region, pairwise class similarities limit the potential gains. Also,
consideration must be made regarding the relative cost of mistaking similar
classes. In security or safety critical tasks, similar classes are likely to
belong to the same group, and thus are equally sensitive.
  In this work, we propose a new approach that utilizes inter-class similarity
to improve the performance of verifiable training and create robust models with
respect to multiple adversarial criteria. First, we use agglomerate clustering
to group similar classes and assign robustness criteria based on the similarity
between clusters. Next, we propose two methods to apply our approach: (1)
Inter-Group Robustness Prioritization, which uses a custom loss term to create
a single model with multiple robustness guarantees and (2) neural decision
trees, which trains multiple sub-classifiers with different robustness
guarantees and combines them in a decision tree architecture. On Fashion-MNIST
and CIFAR10, our approach improves clean performance by 9.63% and 30.89%
respectively. On CIFAR100, our approach improves clean performance by 26.32%.

arbitrary velocity $v$ is studied. The total travel time $t_\mathrm{if}$ is
evaluated both exactly and approximately in the weak field limit, with the
result given as functions of signal velocity, source-lens and lens-observer
distances, angular position of the source and lens mass. Two time delays,
$\Delta t_v$ between signals with different velocities but coming from same
side of the lens and $\Delta t_\mathrm{p}$ between signals from different sides
of the lens, as well as the difference $\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}v}$ between two
$\Delta t_\mathrm{p}$'s are calculated. These time delays are applied to the
gravitational-lensed supernova neutrinos and gravitational waves (GW). It is
shown that the $\Delta t_v$ between different mass eigenstates of supernova
neutrinos can be related to the mass square difference of these eigenstates and
therefore could potentially be used to discriminate neutrino mass orderings,
while the difference $\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}v}$ between neutrino and optical
signals can be correlated with the absolute mass of neutrinos. The formula for
time delay in a general lens mass profile is derived and the result is applied
to the singular isothermal sphere case. For GWs, it is found that the
difference $\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}v}$ between GW and GRB can only reach
$1.45\times 10^{-5}$ second for very large source distance ($2\times 10^4$
[Mpc]) and source angle (10 [as]) if $v_{GM}=(1-3\times 10^{-15})c$. This time
difference is at least three order smaller than uncertainties in time
measurement of the recently observed GW/GRB signals and thus calls for
improvement if $\Delta t_{\mathrm{p}v}$ is to be used to further constrain the
GW velocity.

the field theory can be either orthogonal or symplectic. Analysis of the
Schwinger-Dyson equation for the two-point function in the leading melonic
limit shows that power law scaling behavior in the infrared arises for
fermionic theories when the sign character is non-trivial, and for bosonic
theories when the sign character is trivial. In certain cases, the
Schwinger-Dyson equation can be solved exactly using a quartic polynomial
equation, and the solution interpolates between the ultraviolet scaling
controlled by the spectral parameter and the universal infrared scaling. As a
by-product of our analysis, we see that melonic field theories defined over the
real numbers can be modified by replacing the time derivative by a bilocal
kinetic term with a continuously variable spectral parameter. The infrared
scaling of the resulting two-point function is universal, independent of the

  to Bundled Pricing",,,,,cs.GT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Today, many wireless device providers choose to sell devices bundled with
complementary mobile social services, which exhibit strong positive network
externality. This paper aims to quantify the benefits of selling devices and
complementary services under the following three strategies: separate pricing,
bundled pricing, and hybrid pricing (both the separate and bundled options are
offered). A comprehensive comparison of the above three strategies is carried
out for two popular service models, namely physical connectivity sharing and
virtual content sharing, respectively. We first study the physical service
model where the provider (e.g., FON) offers users customized WiFi devices for
indoor Internet access, and allows service subscribers to physically access all
device owners' WiFi when traveling. Observing that all device-owners contribute
to the connectivity sharing, we show, via a Stackelberg game theoretic
approach, that bundled pricing outperforms separate pricing as long as the
total cost of device and service is reasonably low to stimulate network
externality. Further, hybrid pricing strictly dominates bundled pricing thanks
to the pricing flexibility to keep high marginal profit of device-selling.
Next, we investigate the virtual sharing service model where the provider
(e.g., Apple) sells devices and device-supported applications. Different from
the connectivity service model, in this model service subscribers directly
contribute to the virtual content sharing, and the network externality can be
fairly strong. We prove that hybrid pricing degenerates to bundled pricing if
the network externality degree is larger than the average device valuation,
which is in stark contrast with the connectivity service model in which hybrid
pricing always outperforms bundled pricing.

will incur some cost to run while in the end (or at regular intervals), it will
populate and update local tables that assign (virtual) rewards to participants.
Each participant aspires to offset the costs of participation by these virtual
payoffs that are provided in the course of the protocol. In this setting, we
introduce and study a notion of coalition-safe equilibrium. In particular, we
consider a strategic coalition of participants that is centrally coordinated
and potentially deviates from $\Pi$ with the objective to increase its utility
with respect to the view of {\em at least one} of the other participants. The
protocol $\Pi$ is called a coalition-safe equilibrium with virtual payoffs
(EVP) if no such protocol deviation exists. We apply our notion to study
incentives in blockchain protocols. We proceed to use our framework to provide
a unified picture of incentives in the Bitcoin blockchain, for absolute and
relative rewards based utility functions, as well as prove novel results

that the equilibrium condition holds for collusions up to $n-1$ players for
absolute rewards based utility functions and less than $n/2$ for relative

image analysis. While iconic registration methods have started to benefit from
the recent advances in medical deep learning, the same does not yet apply for
the registration of point sets, e.g. registration based on surfaces, keypoints
or landmarks. This is mainly due to the restriction of the convolution operator
in modern CNNs to densely gridded input. However, with the newly developed
methods from the field of geometric deep learning suitable tools are now
emerging, which enable powerful analysis of medical data on irregular domains.
In this work, we present a new method that enables the learning of regularized
feature descriptors with dynamic graph CNNs. By incorporating the learned
geometric features as prior probabilities into the well-established coherent
point drift (CPD) algorithm, formulated as differentiable network layer, we
establish an end-to-end framework for robust registration of two point sets.
Our approach is evaluated on the challenging task of aligning keypoints
extracted from lung CT scans in inhale and exhale states with large
deformations and without any additional intensity information. Our results
indicate that the inherent geometric structure of the extracted keypoints is
sufficient to establish descriptive point features, which yield a significantly
improved performance and robustness of our registration framework.

this paper, we consider a parallel method for the solution of evolutionary PDEs
with the CN scheme. Using an all-at-once approach, we can solve for all time
steps simultaneously using a parallelizable over time preconditioner within a
standard iterative method. Due to the diagonalization of the proposed
preconditioner, we can prove that most eigenvalues of preconditioned matrices
are equal to 1 and the others lie in the set: $\left\{z\in\mathbb{C}: 1/(1 +
\alpha) < |z| < 1/(1 - \alpha)~{\rm and}~\Re{\rm e}(z) > 0\right\}$, where $0 <

for the first time with highly-charged ions (HCI), using the TITAN facility at
TRIUMF. Compared to singly-charged ions, this provides an improvement in
experimental precision that scales with the charge state q. Neutron-deficient
Rb-isotopes have been charge bred in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8 - 12+
prior to injection into the Penning trap. In combination with the Ramsey
excitation scheme, this unique setup creating low energy, highly-charged ions
at a radioactive beam facility opens the door to unrivalled precision with
gains of 1-2 orders of magnitude. The method is particularly suited for
short-lived nuclides such as the superallowed {\beta} emitter 74Rb (T1/2 = 65
ms). The determination of its atomic mass and an improved QEC-value are
presented.

(Tc). Therefore, single-layer FeSe on a SrTiO3 substrate, with its
extraordinarily high Tc amongst all interfacial superconductors and iron based
superconductors, is particularly interesting, but the mechanism underlying its
high Tc has remained mysterious. Here we show through isotope effects that
electrons in FeSe couple with the oxygen phonons in the substrate, and the
superconductivity is enhanced linearly with the coupling strength atop the
intrinsic superconductivity of heavily-electron-doped FeSe. Our observations
solve the enigma of FeSe/SrTiO3, and experimentally establish the critical role
and unique behavior of electron-phonon forward scattering in a correlated
high-Tc superconductor. The effective cooperation between interlayer
electron-phonon interactions and correlations suggests a path forward in
developing more high-Tc interfacial superconductors, and may shed light on
understanding the high Tc of bulk high temperature superconductors with layered

a trend due to the complementary characteristics of LiDAR point clouds and
image data. However, the performance of multi-modal methods is usually limited
by the sparsity of the point cloud or the noise problem caused by the
misalignment between LiDAR and the camera. To solve these two problems, we
present a new concept, Voxel Region (VR), which is obtained by projecting the
sparse local point clouds in each voxel dynamically. And we propose a novel
fusion method named Sparse-to-Dense Voxel Region Fusion (SDVRF). Specifically,
more pixels of the image feature map inside the VR are gathered to supplement
the voxel feature extracted from sparse points and achieve denser fusion.
Meanwhile, different from prior methods, which project the size-fixed grids,
our strategy of generating dynamic regions achieves better alignment and avoids
introducing too much background noise. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale
fusion framework to extract more contextual information and capture the
features of objects of different sizes. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show
that our method improves the performance of different baselines, especially on
classes of small size, including Pedestrian and Cyclist.

$d(n)$ in terms of the number of rectangles of the square partition. These

a sequence of square partitions such that $d(n)/n^2$ tends to zero for $n$
large enough. For the case of `perfect' partitions, that is, with $d(n)=0$, we
show that, for any fixed powers $s_1,\ldots, s_m$, a square with side length
$n=p_1^{s_1}\cdots p_m^{s_m}$, can have a perfect Mondrian partition only if
$p_1$ satisfies a given lower bound. Moreover, if $n(x)$ is the number of side
lengths $x$ (with $n\le x$) of squares not having a perfect partition, we prove

In their interactions with others, they try to read others' intentions and make
an image of others to choose their actions accordingly. While the way in which
players choose their actions depending on such intentions has been investigated
in game theory, how dynamic changes in intentions by mutually reading others'
intentions are incorporated into game theory has not been explored. We present
a novel formulation of game theory in which players read others' intentions and
change their own through an iterated game. Here, intention is given as a
function of the other's action and the own action to be taken accordingly as
the dependent variable, while the mutual recognition of intention is
represented as the functional dynamics. It is shown that a player suffers no
disadvantage when he/she recognizes the other's intention, whereas the
functional dynamics reach equilibria in which both players' intentions are
optimized. These cover a classical Nash and Stackelberg equilibria but we
extend them in this study: Novel equilibria exist depending on the degree of
mutual recognition. Moreover, the degree to which each player recognizes the
other can also differ. This formulation is applied to resource competition,
duopoly, and prisoner's dilemma games. For example, in the resource competition
game with player-dependent capacity on gaining the resource, the superior
player's recognition leads to the exploitation of the other, while the inferior
player's recognition leads to cooperation through which both players' payoffs
increase.

configurations are adjacent if one can be transformed to the other by moving a
single token along an edge to an adjacent vertex.
  The reduced power $G^{(k)}$ is the transition graph of the master Markov
chain for $k$ identical and indistinguishable stochastic automata with
transition graph $G$. We present propositions related to the structural
properties of reduced graph powers and, most significantly, provide a
construction of minimum cycle bases of $G^{(k)}$. Minimum cycle bases of
reduced graph powers are especially relevant to applications that do not allow
state-dependent coupling of automata to introduce nonequilibrium steady states.

conditions that ensure against violations of microscopic reversibility. In
addition, the minimum cycle basis construction is an interesting combinatorial

is the main dataset utilized for testing and evaluation of the proposed
methods. However, the channel effects incorporated in this dataset and some
others may lack the appropriate modeling of the real-world conditions since it
only considers two distributions for channel models for a single tap
configuration. Therefore, in this paper, a more comprehensive dataset, named as
HisarMod2019.1, is also introduced, considering real-life applicability.
HisarMod2019.1 includes 26 modulation classes passing through the channels with
5 different fading types and several numbers of taps for classification. It is
shown that the proposed model performs better than the existing models in terms
of both accuracy and training time under more realistic conditions. Even more,
surpassed their performance when the RadioML2016.10a dataset is utilized.

gravities is used to construct a class of anisotropic evolution scenarios. In
unimodular GR the determinant of the metric is constrained to be a fixed number
or a function. However, the metric of a generic anisotropic universe is not
compatible with the unimodular constraint, so that a redefinition of the
metric, to properly take into account the constraint, need be performed. The
unimodular constraint is imposed on $F(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame by means
of a Lagrangian multiplier, to get the equations of motion. The resulting
equations can be viewed as a reconstruction method, which allows to determine
what function of the Ricci scalar can realize the desired evolution. For the
sake of clarity, some characteristic examples are invoked to show how this
reconstruction method works explicitly. The de Sitter spacetime here
considered, in the context of unimodular $F(R)$ gravity, is suitable to

stage of evolution in the nuclear region. The paper, second of a series,
focuses on the comparison between UV features detected by Swift-UVOT, tracing
recent star formation, and the galaxy optical structure mapping older stellar
populations. We performed their UV surface photometry and used BVRI photometry
from other sources. Our integrated magnitudes have been analyzed and compared
with corresponding values in the literature. We characterize the overall galaxy
structure best fitting the UV and optical luminosity profiles using a single
Sersic law. NGC 1366, NGC 1426, NGC 3818, NGC 3962 and NGC 7192 show
featureless luminosity profiles. Excluding NGC 1366 which has a clear edge-on
disk , n~1-2, and NGC 3818, the remaining three have Sersic's indices n~3-4 in
optical and a lower index in the UV. Bright ring/arm-like structures are
revealed by UV images and luminosity profiles of NGC 1415, NGC 1533, NGC 1543,
NGC 2685, NGC 2974 and IC 2006. The ring/arm-like structures are different from
galaxy to galaxy. Sersic indices of UV profiles for those galaxies are in the
range n=1.5-3 both in S0s and in Es. In our sample optical Sersic indices are
usually larger than the UV ones. (M2-V) color profiles are bluer in
ring/arm-like structures with respect to the galaxy body. The lower values of
Sersic's indices in the UV bands with respect to optical ones, suggesting the
presence of a disk, point out that the role of the dissipation cannot be
neglected in recent evolutionary phases of these early-type galaxies.

is drawn according to a distribution which is a function of the states of its
two nearest neighbours at time $t$, and of its own state at time $t-1$. Such
PCA naturally arise in the study of some models coming from statistical physics
($8$-vertex model, directed animals and gaz models, TASEP, etc.). We give
conditions for which the invariant measure has a product form or a Markovian
form, and we prove an ergodicity result holding in that context. The stationary
space-time diagrams of these PCA present different forms of reversibility. We
describe and study extensively this phenomenon, which provides families of
Gibbs random fields on the square lattice having nice geometric and

open-ended evolution in artificial evolutionary systems exemplifies this goal.
However, open-ended evolution research is hampered by two fundamental issues;
the struggle to replicate open-endedness in an artificial evolutionary system,
and the fact that we only have one system (genetic evolution) from which to
draw inspiration. Here we argue that cultural evolution should be seen not only
as another real-world example of an open-ended evolutionary system, but that
the unique qualities seen in cultural evolution provide us with a new
perspective from which we can assess the fundamental properties of, and ask new
questions about, open-ended evolutionary systems, especially in regard to
evolved open-endedness and transitions from bounded to unbounded evolution.
Here we provide an overview of culture as an evolutionary system, highlight the
interesting case of human cultural evolution as an open-ended evolutionary
system, and contextualise cultural evolution under the framework of (evolved)
open-ended evolution. We go on to provide a set of new questions that can be
asked once we consider cultural evolution within the framework of open-ended
evolution, and introduce new insights that we may be able to gain about evolved
open-endedness as a result of asking these questions.

ensuing dynamics that describes the creation of synchronous binaries and all

binaries, ternary systems, and contact binaries. Our model only presupposes the
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect, ""rubble pile"" asteroid
geophysics, and gravitational interactions. The YORP effect torques a ""rubble
pile"" asteroid until the asteroid reaches its fission spin limit and the
components enter orbit about each other (Scheeres, D.J. [2007]. Icarus 189,
370-385). Non-spherical gravitational potentials couple the spin states to the
orbit state and chaotically drive the system towards the observed asteroid
classes along two evolutionary tracks primarily distinguished by mass ratio.
Related to this is a new binary process termed secondary fission - the
secondary asteroid of the binary system is rotationally accelerated via
gravitational torques until it fissions, thus creating a chaotic ternary
system. The initially chaotic binary can be stabilized to create a synchronous
binary by components of the fissioned secondary asteroid impacting the primary
asteroid, solar gravitational perturbations, and mutual body tides. These
results emphasize the importance of the initial component size distribution and
configuration within the parent asteroid. NEAs may go through multiple binary
cycles and many YORP-induced rotational fissions during their approximately 10
Myr lifetime in the inner Solar System. Rotational fission and the ensuing
dynamics are responsible for all NEA systems including the most commonly
observed synchronous binaries.

controlled programs to disentangle the knowledge from other biases. The
programs can select one or two triplets from the scene graph or knowledge base

following two major constraints on the programs to incorporate knowledge
reasoning: i) multiple knowledge triplets can be related to the question, but
only one knowledge relates to the image object. This can enforce the VQA model
to correctly perceive the image instead of guessing the knowledge based on the
given question solely; ii) all questions are based on different knowledge, but
the candidate answers are the same for both the training and test sets.

polar or nematic homogeneous order. For dipolar swimmers, the stroke averaged
dynamics are enough to determine the leading contributions to the collective
behaviour. In contrast, for quadrupolar swimmers, our analysis shows that
detailed features of the internal dynamics play an important role in
determining the bulk behaviour. In the broken symmetry phases, we investigate
fluctuations of hydrodynamic variables of the system and find that these

NMSSM-like scenario where U(1)' gauge invariance is used to forbid a tree-level
mu term, and present concrete models, which admit successful dynamical
electroweak symmetry breaking. Gaugino masses are somewhat lighter than the
scalar masses, and the third generation squarks are lighter than the first two.
In the specific class of models under consideration, the gluino is light since
it only receives a contribution from 2-loop anomaly mediation, and it decays
dominantly into third generation quarks. Gluino production leads to distinct
LHC signals and prospects of early discovery. In addition, there is a
relatively light Z', with mass in the range of several TeV. Discovering and
studying its properties can reveal important clues about the underlying model.

the time-dependent probability distribution function generating correlators of

technique to calculate non-linear corrections to cosmological correlators,
similar to the diagrammatic expansion in a three-dimensional Euclidean quantum
field theory, with time playing the role of an external parameter. For the
physically relevant case of cold dark matter in an Einstein--de Sitter

and is encapsulated by a time-dependent coupling constant controlling the
perturbative expansion. We show that all building blocks of the expansion are
free from spurious infrared enhanced contributions that plague the standard
cosmological perturbation theory. This paves the way towards the systematic
resummation of infrared effects in large scale structure formation. We also
argue that the approach proposed here provides a natural framework to account

as the limit of the generalized, nonequilibrium free energy of a Markovian

orthogonal field $\gamma(x)\perp\nabla\varphi$, a general vector field $b(x)$
can be decomposed into $-D(x)\nabla\varphi+\gamma$, where
$\nabla\cdot\big(\omega(x)\gamma(x)\big)=$ $-\nabla\omega D(x)\nabla\varphi$.
The matrix $D(x)$ and scalar $\omega(x)$, two additional characteristics to the

the statistical motion in the state space at $x$. $\varphi(x)$ and $\omega(x)$
are interpreted as the emergent energy and degeneracy of the motion, with an

perturbation, and discuss the question of defining a time dependent particle
number not just at asymptotic early and late times, but also during the
perturbation. Naively, this is not a well-defined notion for such a
non-equilibrium process, as the particle number at intermediate times depends
on a basis choice of reference states with respect to which particles and
anti-particles are defined, even though the final late-time particle number is
independent of this basis choice. The basis choice is associated with a
particular truncation of the adiabatic expansion. The adiabatic expansion is
divergent, and we show that if this divergent expansion is truncated at its
optimal order, a universal time dependence is obtained, confirming a general
result of Dingle and Berry. This optimally truncated particle number provides a
clear picture of quantum interference effects for perturbations with
non-trivial temporal sub-structure. We illustrate these results using several
equivalent definitions of adiabatic particle number: the Bogoliubov, Riccati,
Spectral Function and Schrodinger picture approaches. In each approach, the
particle number may be expressed in terms of the tiny deviations between the
exact and adiabatic solutions of the Ermakov-Milne equation for the associated

prolongations inductively as `derivations of degree 0, 1, etc. Of course,
vector fields of weight $k$ with respect to the dilation define automatically
derivations of weight $k$, so the Tanaka prolongation is in this case never
finite. Are they all such derivations given by vector fields or there are
additional `strange'ones? We answer this question. Except for special cases,
derivations of degree 0 are given by vector fields of degree 0 and the Tanaka
prolongation recovers the whole algebra of polynomial vectors defined by the
dilation. However, in some particular cases of dilations we can find `strange'
derivations which we describe in detail

capabilities, vehicle routing and ride-matching algorithms can improve the
efficiency of private transportation services. However, existing routing
solutions do not address where drivers should travel after dropping off a
passenger and before receiving the next passenger ride request, i.e., during
the between-ride period. We address this problem by developing an efficient
algorithm to find the optimal policy for drivers between rides in order to
maximize driver profits. We model the road network as a graph, and we show that
the between-ride routing problem is equivalent to a stochastic shortest path
problem, an infinite dynamic program with no discounting. We prove under
reasonable assumptions that an optimal routing policy exists that avoids
cycles; policies of this type can be efficiently found. We present an iterative
approach to find an optimal routing policy. Our approach can account for
various factors, including the frequency of passenger ride requests at
different locations, traffic conditions, and surge pricing. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach by implementing it on road network data from
Boston and New York City.

\emph{randomized} algorithm for checking $k$-connectivity in near-optimal
$\widehat{O}(m)$ time. (We use $\widehat{O}(\cdot)$ to hide an $n^{o(1)}$
factor.) Deterministic algorithms, unfortunately, have remained much slower
even if we assume a linear-time max-flow algorithm: they either require at
least $\Omega(mn)$ time [Even'75; Henzinger Rao and Gabow, FOCS'96; Gabow,
FOCS'00] or assume that $k=o(\sqrt{\log n})$ [Saranurak and

checking $k$-vertex connectivity in time proportional to making
$\widehat{O}(k^{2})$ max-flow calls, and, hence, in $\widehat{O}(mk^{2})$ time
using the deterministic max-flow algorithm by [Brand et al. FOCS'23]. Our
algorithm gives the first almost-linear-time bound for all $k$ where
$\sqrt{\log n}\le k\le n^{o(1)}$ and subsumes up to a sub polynomial factor the
long-standing state-of-the-art algorithm by [Even'75] which requires
$O(n+k^{2})$ max-flow calls. Our key technique is a deterministic algorithm for
terminal reduction for vertex connectivity: given a terminal set separated by a
vertex mincut, output either a vertex mincut or a smaller terminal set that
remains separated by a vertex mincut. We also show a deterministic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for vertex connectivity that makes
$O(n/\epsilon^2)$ max-flow calls, improving the bound of $O(n^{1.5})$ max-flow
calls in the exact algorithm of [Gabow, FOCS'00]. The technique is based on

become an active research area from many years as many apps are vulnerable to
different attacks. Especially the concept of hybrid applications has emerged in
the last three years where applications are developed in both native and web
languages because the use of web languages raises certain security risks in
hybrid mobile applications as it creates possible channels where malicious code
can be injected inside the application. WebView is an important component in
hybrid mobile applications which used to implements a sandbox mechanism to
protect the local resources of smartphone devices from un-authorized access of
JavaScript. However, the WebView application program interfaces (APIs) also
have security issues. For example, an attacker can attack the hybrid
application via JavaScript code by bypassing the sandbox security through
accessing the public methods of the applications. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is
one of the most popular malicious code injection technique for accessing the
public methods of the application through JavaScript. This research proposes a
framework for detection and prevention of XSS attacks in hybrid applications
using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms. The detection of the
attacks have been perform by exploiting the registered Java object features.
The dataset and the sample hybrid applications have been developed using the

empirical analysis. The results reveal that the ensemble based Random Forest

of CuO and the subsequent theoretical efforts to understand this intriguing
phenomenon, we study a spin model on a two-dimensional square lattice which
possesses some of the key features of the models proposed for CuO. The model
consists of Heisenberg couplings between nearest and next-nearest neighbor
spins, and biquadratic couplings between nearest neighbors. We use a
combination of variational calculations and classical Monte Carlo simulations
to study this model at zero and finite temperatures. We show that even an
arbitrarily weak biquadratic coupling plays a crucial role in selecting the
magnetic ground state. More importantly, a non-collinear magnetic state,
characterized by a finite spin current, is stable at finite temperatures. The
interesting aspect is that the present model neither includes an
inversion-symmetry-breaking term nor the effects of lattice distortions in the
Hamiltonian. We conclude that non-collinear magnetism at high temperatures, as
observed in CuO, can be explained via pure spin Hamiltonians. We find that the
spiral phase is inhomogeneous, and is stabilized by entropic effects. Our study
demonstrates that higher order interaction terms are of crucial importance if
the stronger interactions together with the lattice geometry contemplate to
generate a near degeneracy of magnetic states. The conclusions presented in
this work are of particular relevance to the non-collinear magnetism and
ferroelectricity observed at high temperatures in cupric oxide.

temperature, force, and contact point positions to predict the sensor outputs.
We show that training with BioTac temperature readings does not yield accurate

transformer encoder. We train these models without temperature readings and
provide a detailed investigation of the window size of the input vectors. We
demonstrate that we achieve statistically significant improvements over the

We cataloged the long-lasting GRBs observed by the \textsl{Swift} between 2004
December and 2014 February in 3 categories according to the classification by
\citet{2008ApJ...679..570S}: X-Ray Flashes (XRFs), X-Ray Rich GRBs (XRRs), and
Classical GRBs (C-GRBs). We then derived $E^{{\rm obs}}_{{\rm peak}}$, as well
as $E^{{\rm src}}_{{\rm peak}}$ if viable, of the \textsl{Swift} spectra of
their prompt emission. We also analyzed their X-Ray afterglows and found the
trend that the GRB events with a lower $E_{{\rm peak}}^{{\rm src}}$, i.e.
softer GRBs, are fainter in the 0.3--10 keV X-ray luminosity and decay more
slowly than harder GRBs. The intrinsic event rates of the XRFs, XRRs, and
C-GRBs were calculated, using the \textsl{Swift}/BAT trigger algorithm. That of
either of the XRRs and XRFs is larger than that of the C-GRBs. If we assume
that the observational diversity of $E_{{\rm peak}}$ is explained with the
off-axis model \citep{2002ApJ...571L..31Y,2004ApJ...607L..103Y}, these results
yield the jet half-opening angle of $\Delta\theta\sim 0.3^\circ$, and the
variance of the observing angles $\theta_{{\rm obs}} \lesssim0.6^{\circ}$. This
implies that the tiny variance of the observing angles of $\lesssim0.6^{\circ}$
would be responsible for the $E_{{\rm peak}}$ diversity observed by
\textsl{Swift}/BAT, which is unrealistic. Therefore, we conclude that the
$E_{{\rm peak}}$ diversity is not explained with the off-axis model, but is
likely to originate from some intrinsic properties of the jets.

homogeneous and nonexpanding. In a radiation- dominated universe, we find that
radiation diffuses into the void at approximately the speed of light as a
strong shock---the void collapses. We also find the surprising result that the
cosmic collapse time (the $1^{\rm st}$-crossing time) is much smaller than
previously thought, because it depends not only on the radius of the void, but
also on the ratio of the temperature inside the void to that outside. If the
ratio of the initial void radius to the outside Hubble radius is less than the
ratio of the outside temperature to that inside, then the collapse occurs in
less than the outside Hubble time. Thus, superhorizon-sized relativistic void
may thermalize and homogenize relatively quickly. These new simulations revise

field theory is presented. We utilize the one-particle irreducible vertex parts
framework to deal only with the primitive divergent ones that can be
renormalized multiplicatively. We give a unified description for spacetime
metric tensor with either Minkowski or Euclidean signature.The partial-p
operation in the remaining diagrams of the two-point vertex part are used to
get rid of its overlapping divergences. We show how the parametric dissociation
transform effectively eliminates the external momentum dependence of the
coefficient of the squared bare mass after performing the partial-p operation
in the two-point vertex part diagrams. The resemblance of this method with a
minimal subtraction scheme in the massless theory is pointed out. We derive the
Callan-Symanzik equations using minimal subtraction arguments and discuss the
scaling limit in the ultraviolet region. We apply the method to determine
critical exponents for an O(N) internal symmetry at least up to two-loop order
with a flat Euclidean metric and find perfect agreement with all previous
results in the literature.

Particularly, the amplitude of long-term IR variation is over one order of
magnitude and the IR variability timescale can be constrained as short as a few
hours in the source frame. The IR and $\gamma$-ray light curves are found to be
rather similar, and the strong quasi-simultaneous infrared and $\gamma$-ray

described. The $\gamma-$ray flares from some blazars as distant as redshift

experiment BICEP2 of tensor fluctuations in the B-mode power spectrum basically
excludes all plausible axion models where its decay constant is above $10^{13}$
GeV. Moreover, there are strong theoretical, astrophysical, and cosmological
motivations for models involving, in addition to the axion, also axion-like
particles (ALPs), with decay constants in the intermediate scale range, between
$10^9$ GeV and $10^{13}$ GeV. Here, we present a general analysis of models
with an axion and further ALPs and derive bounds on the relative size of the
axion and ALP photon (and electron) coupling. We discuss what we can learn from
measurements of the axion and ALP photon couplings about the fundamental
parameters of the underlying ultraviolet completion of the theory. For the
latter we consider extensions of the Standard Model in which the axion and the
ALP(s) appear as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the breaking of global
chiral $U(1)$ (Peccei-Quinn (PQ)) symmetries, occuring accidentally as low
energy remnants from exact discrete symmetries. In such models, the axion and
the further ALP are protected from disastrous explicit symmetry breaking
effects due to Planck-scale suppressed operators. The scenarios considered
exploit heavy right handed neutrinos getting their mass via PQ symmetry
breaking and thus explain the small mass of the active neutrinos via a seesaw
relation between the electroweak and an intermediate PQ symmetry breaking
scale. We show some models that can accommodate simultaneously an axion dark
matter candidate, an ALP explaining the anomalous transparency of the universe
for $\gamma$-rays, and an ALP explaining the recently reported 3.55 keV gamma
line from galaxies and clusters of galaxies, if the respective decay constants
are of intermediate scale.

reorientation of smectic A like systems, we consider an extended formulation of
smectic A hydrodynamics. We include both, the smectic layering (via the layer
displacement u and the layer normal p) and the director n of the underlying
nematic order in our macroscopic hydrodynamic description and allow both
directions to differ in non equilibrium situations. In an homeotropically
aligned sample the nematic director does couple to an applied simple shear,
whereas the smectic layering stays unchanged. This difference leads to a finite
(but usually small) angle between n and p, which we find to be equivalent to an
effective dilatation of the layers. This effective dilatation leads, above a
certain threshold, to an undulation instability of the layers. We generalize
our earlier approach [Rheol. Acta, vol.39(3), 15] and include the cross
couplings with the velocity field and the order parameters for orientational
and positional order and show how the order parameters interact with the

Operations Team (SOT) is structured independently from the instrument teams and
the Mission Operations Team. The responsibilities of the SOT are divided into
four categories: 1) guest observer program and data distributions, 2)
distribution of analysis software and the calibration database, 3) guest
observer support activities, and 4) performance verification and optimization
activities. As the first step, lessons on the science operations learned from
past Japanese X-ray missions are reviewed, and 15 kinds of lessons are
identified. Among them, a) the importance of early preparation of the
operations from the ground stage, b) construction of an independent team for
science operations separate from the instrument development, and c) operations
with well-defined duties by appointed members are recognized as key lessons.
Then, the team structure and the task division between the mission and science
operations are defined; the tasks are shared among Japan, US, and Europe and
are performed by three centers, the SOC, SDC, and ESAC, respectively. The SOC
is designed to perform tasks close to the spacecraft operations, such as
spacecraft planning, quick-look health checks, pre-pipeline processing, etc.,
and the SDC covers tasks regarding data calibration processing, maintenance of
analysis tools, etc. The data-archive and user-support activities are covered
both by the SOC and SDC. Finally, the science-operations tasks and tools are
defined and prepared before launch.

important. To use such data-driven systems wisely we must understand how they
interact with the world, including how they depend causally on data inputs. In
this work we develop Causal Dependence Plots (CDPs) to visualize how one
variable--an outcome--depends on changes in another variable--a
predictor--$\textit{along with any consequent causal changes in other predictor
variables}$. Crucially, CDPs differ from standard methods based on holding
other predictors constant or assuming they are independent. CDPs make use of an
auxiliary causal model because causal conclusions require causal assumptions.
With simulations and real data experiments, we show CDPs can be combined in a
modular way with methods for causal learning or sensitivity analysis. Since
people often think causally about input-output dependence, CDPs can be powerful
tools in the xAI or interpretable machine learning toolkit and contribute to
applications like scientific machine learning and algorithmic fairness.

a procedure to investigate selectivity is outlined, and a more robust way to
analyze the selectivity-activity trade-off is presented. For this single-atom

familiar notion of dimension which, for a given metric space, returns the
minimal exponent $\alpha\geq 0$ such that for any pair of scales $0<r<R$, any
ball of radius $R$ may be covered by a constant times $(R/r)^\alpha$ balls of
radius $r$. To each $\theta \in (0,1)$, we associate the appropriate analogue
of the Assouad dimension with the restriction that the two scales $r$ and $R$
used in the definition satisfy $\log R/\log r = \theta$. The resulting
`dimension spectrum' (as a function of $\theta$) thus gives finer geometric
information regarding the scaling structure of the space and, in some precise
sense, interpolates between the upper box dimension and the Assouad dimension.
This latter point is particularly useful because the spectrum is generally
better behaved than the Assouad dimension. We also consider the corresponding
`lower spectrum', motivated by the lower dimension, which acts as a dual to the
Assouad spectrum.
  We conduct a detailed study of these dimension spectra; including analytic,
geometric, and measureability properties. We also compute the spectra
explicitly for some common examples of fractals including decreasing sequences
with decreasing gaps and spirals with sub-exponential and monotonic winding. We
also give several applications of our results, including: dimension distortion
estimates under bi-H\""older maps for Assouad dimension and the provision of new
bi-Lipschitz invariants.

within this area to collect information from scheduled devices in several
epochs via OFDMA due to potential limited number of channels available in

baryons composed of light quarks ($q=u,d$). We systematize baryons using the
notion of two diquarks: (i) axial--vector state, $D^{1}_{1}$, with the spin
$S_D=1$ and isospin $I_D=1$ and (ii) scalar one, $D^{0}_{0}$, with the spin
$S_D=0$ and isospin $I_D=0$. We consider several schemes for the composed
baryons: (1) with different diquark masses, $M_{D^0_0} \ne M_{D^1_1}$, (2) with
$M_{D^0_0} = M_{D^1_1}$ and overlapping $qD^0_0$ and $qD^1_1$ states
(resonances), (3) with/without SU(6) constraints for low-lying states (with
quark--diquark orbital momenta L=0). In the high-mass region the model predicts
several baryon resonances at $M\sim 2.0-2.9$ GeV. Moreover, the model gives us
the double pole structure (i.e. two poles with the same Re$M$ but different
Im$M$) in many amplitudes at masses $M\ga 2.0$ GeV. We see also that for
description of low-lying baryons (with L=0), the SU(6) constraint is needed.

classification is an important challenge. The usual procedure is to fit a model
for the longitudinal response in the healthy population, a different model for

theorem to obtain disease probabilities given the responses. Unfortunately,
when substantial heterogeneity exists within each population, this type of
Bayes classification may perform poorly. In this paper, we develop a new
approach by fitting a Bayesian nonparametric model for the joint outcome of
disease status and longitudinal response, and then use the clustering induced
by the Dirichlet process in our model to increase the flexibility of the
method, allowing for multiple subpopulations of healthy, diseased, and possibly
mixed membership. In addition, we introduce an MCMC sampling scheme that
facilitates the assessment of the inference and prediction capabilities of our
model. Finally, we demonstrate the method by predicting pregnancy outcomes
using longitudinal profiles on the $\beta$--HCG hormone levels in a sample of

connected kinodynamic chain, which can be viewed as a special class of
floating-base robot systems. However, unlike general floating-base robot
systems, human users are the bases of SRAs and they have their subjective
behaviors/motions. This implies that human body motions can unintentionally
affect the SRA's end-effector movements. To address this challenge, we propose
a framework to compensate for the human whole-body motions that interfere with
the SRA's end-effector trajectories. The SRA system in this study consists of a
6-degree-of-freedom lightweight arm and a wearable interface. The wearable
interface allows users to adjust the installation position of the SRA to fit
different body shapes. An inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based sensory
interface can provide the body skeleton motion feedback of the human user in
real time. By simplifying the floating-base kinematics model, we design an
effective motion planner by reconstructing the Jacobian matrix of the SRA.
Under the proposed framework, the performance of the reconstructed Jacobian
method is assessed by comparing the results obtained with the classical
nullspace-based method through two sets of experiments.

that no longer needs to convert between different types of secret sharings and
is entirely based on arithmetic secret sharing. Compared with the previous

  in Encrypted Databases","23pages, 13 figures, will be published in USENIX Security'24",,,,cs.CR,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Dynamic Searchable Encryption (DSE) has emerged as a solution to efficiently
handle and protect large-scale data storage in encrypted databases (EDBs).
Volume leakage poses a significant threat, as it enables adversaries to
reconstruct search queries and potentially compromise the security and privacy
of data. Padding strategies are common countermeasures for the leakage, but
they significantly increase storage and communication costs. In this work, we
develop a new perspective to handle volume leakage. We start with distinct
search and further explore a new concept called \textit{distinct} DSE
(\textit{d}-DSE).
  We also define new security notions, in particular Distinct with
Volume-Hiding security, as well as forward and backward privacy, for the new
concept. Based on \textit{d}-DSE, we construct the \textit{d}-DSE designed EDB
with related constructions for distinct keyword (d-KW-\textit{d}DSE), keyword
(KW-\textit{d}DSE), and join queries (JOIN-\textit{d}DSE) and update queries in
encrypted databases. We instantiate a concrete scheme \textsf{BF-SRE},
employing Symmetric Revocable Encryption. We conduct extensive experiments on
real-world datasets, such as Crime, Wikipedia, and Enron, for performance
evaluation. The results demonstrate that our scheme is practical in data search
and with comparable computational performance to the SOTA DSE scheme
(\textsf{MITRA}*, \textsf{AURA}) and padding strategies (\textsf{SEAL},
\textsf{ShieldDB}). Furthermore, our proposal sharply reduces the communication
cost as compared to padding strategies, with roughly 6.36 to 53.14x advantage
for search queries.

(e.g., images). Recently we developed the methodology of using (dense)
Compressed Counting for recovering nonnegative K-sparse signals. In this paper,
we adopt very sparse Compressed Counting for nonnegative signal recovery. Our
design matrix is sampled from a maximally-skewed p-stable distribution (0<p<1),
and we sparsify the design matrix so that on average (1-g)-fraction of the
entries become zero. The idea is related to very sparse stable random
projections (Li et al 2006 and Li 2007), the prior work for estimating summary
statistics of the data.
  In our theoretical analysis, we show that, when p->0, it suffices to use M=
K/(1-exp(-gK) log N measurements, so that all coordinates can be recovered in
one scan of the coordinates. If g = 1 (i.e., dense design), then M = K log N.
If g= 1/K or 2/K (i.e., very sparse design), then M = 1.58K log N or M = 1.16K
log N. This means the design matrix can be indeed very sparse at only a minor
inflation of the sample complexity.
  Interestingly, as p->1, the required number of measurements is essentially M
= 2.7K log N, provided g= 1/K. It turns out that this result is a general
worst-case bound.

applications with the evolution of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of
Things. These systems are subjected to stringent constraints so that embedded
software must be optimized for multiple objectives simultaneously, namely
reduced energy consumption, execution time, and code size. Compilers offer
optimization phases to improve these metrics. However, proper selection and
ordering of them depends on multiple factors and typically requires expert
knowledge. State-of-the-art optimizers facilitate different platforms and
applications case by case, and they are limited by optimizing one metric at a
time, as well as requiring a time-consuming adaptation for different targets
through dynamic profiling.
  To address these problems, we propose the novel MLComp methodology, in which
optimization phases are sequenced by a Reinforcement Learning-based policy.
Training of the policy is supported by Machine Learning-based analytical models
for quick performance estimation, thereby drastically reducing the time spent
for dynamic profiling. In our framework, different Machine Learning models are
automatically tested to choose the best-fitting one. The trained Performance
Estimator model is leveraged to efficiently devise Reinforcement Learning-based
multi-objective policies for creating quasi-optimal phase sequences.
  Compared to state-of-the-art estimation models, our Performance Estimator
model achieves lower relative error (<2%) with up to 50x faster training time
over multiple platforms and application domains. Our Phase Selection Policy
improves execution time and energy consumption of a given code by up to 12% and
6%, respectively. The Performance Estimator and the Phase Selection Policy can
be trained efficiently for any target platform and application domain.

of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the initial optimism that reasoning
might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of
counterexamples--ranging from multiplication to simple planning--there persists
a wide spread belief that LLMs can self-critique and improve their own
solutions in an iterative fashion. This belief seemingly rests on the
assumption that verification of correctness should be easier than generation--a
rather classical argument from computational complexity--which should be
irrelevant to LLMs to the extent that what they are doing is approximate
retrieval. In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the
effectiveness of iterative prompting in the context of reasoning and planning.
We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT-4 in three
domains: Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning. We experiment both
with the model critiquing its own answers and with an external correct reasoner
verifying proposed solutions. In each case, we analyze whether the content of
criticisms actually affects bottom line performance, and whether we can ablate
elements of the augmented system without losing performance. We observe
significant performance collapse with self-critique, significant performance
gains with sound external verification, but that the content of critique
doesn't matter to the performance of the system. In fact, merely re-prompting
with a sound verifier maintains most of the benefits of more involved setups.

convolutional neural networks (CNN), going smaller for CNN has received
increasing attention recently due to its attractiveness for mobile/embedded
applications. It remains an active and important topic how to design a small
network while retaining the performance of large and deep CNNs (e.g., Inception
Nets, ResNets). Albeit there are already intensive studies on compressing the
size of CNNs, the considerable drop of performance is still a key concern in
many designs. This paper addresses this concern with several new contributions.
First, we propose a simple yet powerful method for compressing the size of deep
CNNs based on parameter binarization. The striking difference from most
previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different
treatments of $1\times 1$ convolutions and $k\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$),
where we only binarize $k\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. The
resulting networks are referred to as pattern networks. By doing this, we show
that previous deep CNNs such as GoogLeNet and Inception-type Nets can be
compressed dramatically with marginal drop in performance. Second, in light of
the different functionalities of $1\times 1$ (data projection/transformation)
and $k\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block
structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature
maps generated by $1\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps
generated by $k\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network
with $\sim 1$ million parameters. Combining with our parameter binarization, we
achieve better performance on ImageNet than using similar sized networks
including recently released Google MobileNets.

an extension of the perturbation model focused on the high-dimensional data
framework, called the ProMises (Procrustes von Mises-Fisher) model. The
ill-posed and interpretability problems are solved by imposing a proper prior
distribution for the orthogonal matrix parameter (i.e., the von Mises-Fisher
distribution) which is a conjugate prior, resulting in a fast estimation
process. Furthermore, we present the Efficient ProMises model for the
high-dimensional framework, useful in neuroimaging, where the problem has much
more than three dimensions. We found a great improvement in functional magnetic

40 K. By analyzing photometric available light minimum times, we also derived
an update ephemeris and found for the first time a possible periodic
oscillation with an amplitude of 0.011 days and a period of 9.6 years. The
results indicate that the periodic oscillation could be caused by a third
component physically attached to the eclipsing binary. After removing the light
variations due to the eclipses and proximity effects, the light-curve

with a dominant period of 1 day. In accordance with the position of the primary

fundamental interest. In some cases one examines the short term response
wherein the disturbance is still local and the boundaries have not yet come
into play, and for such short-time analysis the geometrical extent of the
structure may be taken as unbounded. Here we examine the response of slender
beams to angular impulses. The Euler-Bernoulli model, which does not include
rotary inertia of cross sections, predicts an unphysical and unbounded initial
rotation at the point of application. A finite length Euler-Bernoulli beam,
when modelled using finite elements, predicts a mesh-dependent response that
shows fast large-amplitude oscillations setting in very quickly. The simplest
introduction of rotary inertia yields the Rayleigh beam model, which has more
reasonable behaviour including a finite wave speed at all frequencies. If a
Rayleigh beam is given an impulsive moment at a location away from its
boundaries, then the predicted behaviour has an instantaneous finite jump in
local slope or rotation, followed by smooth evolution of the slope for a finite
time interval until reflections arrive from the boundary, causing subsequent
slope discontinuities in time. We present a detailed study of the angular
impulse response of a simply supported Rayleigh beam, starting with dimensional
analysis, followed by modal expansion including all natural frequencies,
culminating with an asymptotic formula for the short-time response. The
asymptotic formula is obtained by breaking the series solution into two parts
to be treated independently term by term, and leads to a polynomial in time.
The polynomial matches the response from refined finite element (FE)
simulations.

an effectively exhaustive search with a validation technique on a single Random

using software execution logs has been explored in several prior studies, using
both classical and deep neural network-based machine learning models. In recent
years, the research has largely focused in using variations of sequence-based
deep neural networks (e.g., Long-Short Term Memory and Transformer-based
models) for log-based anomaly detection on open-source data. However, they have
not been applied in industrial datasets, as often. In addition, the studied
open-source datasets are typically very large in size with logging statements
that do not change much over time, which may not be the case with a dataset
from an industrial service that is relatively new. In this paper, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art anomaly detection models on an industrial dataset from
our research partner, which is much smaller and loosely structured than most
large scale open-source benchmark datasets. Results show that while all models
are capable of detecting anomalies, certain models are better suited for
less-structured datasets. We also see that model effectiveness changes when a
common data leak associated with a random train-test split in some prior work
is removed. A qualitative study of the defects' characteristics identified by
the developers on the industrial dataset further shows strengths and weaknesses
of the models in detecting different types of anomalies. Finally, we explore
the effect of limited training data by gradually increasing the training set
size, to evaluate if the model effectiveness does depend on the training set
size.

as a simplified model for the magnetism of presumed ordered spin and charge

the $t-t'-t''-J$ model, show good agreement with the ordering temperature of
the recently observed spin density wave condensation in La$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$. We

billion smartcards, used in applications ranging from secure payments to
telecommunications. While the platform is a popular choice for established
commercial use cases (e.g., SIM cards in telecommunication networks), it has
notably low adoption rates in: 1) application scenarios requiring
recently-standardized cryptographic algorithms, 2) research projects, and 3)
open source initiatives. We attribute this to the restricted access to
low-level cryptographic primitives (e.g., elliptic curve operations) and the
lack of essential data types (e.g., Integers). While the underlying hardware
has those capabilities, the JavaCard API does not provide calls for the
corresponding functionality. Until now, the only available workaround was
manufacturer-specific proprietary APIs that come with very restrictive
non-disclosure agreements.
  In this paper, we introduce a methodology to efficiently derive essential
data types and low-level cryptographic primitives from high-level operations.
Our techniques are ideal for resource-constrained platforms, and make optimal
use of the underlying hardware, while having a small memory footprint. We also
introduce JCMathLib, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first generic
library for low-level cryptographic operations in JavaCards that does not rely

expected in a zero-range correlated model). We also find a topological
contribution directly related to the topological entropy, provided that the
partitions are topologically non-trivial in both directions on a torus. We also
show that the negativity captures only quantum contributions to the

show that the majority of atomic sites near the grain boundary have segregation
energies lower than in the bulk. Moreover, depending on the boundary, the
segregation energies approach the bulk value approximately 5-12 \AA\ away from

low elastic modulus to conform to the surface roughness of the adhered
material. Under external loads, however, soft adhesives accumulate strain
energy, which release drives the propagation of interfacial flaws prompting
detachment. The ideal adhesive is then soft but rigid. The solution to this
controversial requirement is a bi-material adhesive having a soft tip, for
surface conformation, and a rigid backing, for reduced strain energy release,
hence, better adhesive strength. This design strategy is widely observed in
nature across multiple species. However, the detachment mechanisms of these
adhesives are poorly understood and quantitative analysis of their adhesive
strength is still missing. Based on linear elastic fracture mechanics, we
analyze the strength of axisymmetric bi-material adhesives. We observed two
main detachment mechanisms, namely (i) center crack propagation and (ii) edge
crack propagation. If the soft tip is sufficiently thin, mechanism (i)
dominates and provides stable crack propagation, thereby toughening the
interface. We ultimately provide the maximum theoretical strength of these
adhesives obtaining closed form estimates for the detachment stress independent
of the crack size, rendering the interface flaw tolerant.

examples, they simply opt to provide coarser predictions. Motivated by this, a

the long-tail problem, combining realism with hierarchical predictions. The
model has the option to reject classifying samples at different levels of the
taxonomy, once it cannot guarantee the desired performance. Deep-RTC is
implemented with a stochastic tree sampling during training to simulate all

range from 2.7 arcseconds to 5.4 arcseconds over the POSS epochs and post-shock
temperatures range from kT ~ 100-200 eV. Our analysis suggests a cosmic ray to
post-shock gas pressure consistent with zero, and in some positions P_CR is
formally smaller than zero. We conclude that the distance to the Cygnus Loop is
close to the upper limit given by the distance to the background star and that

accretion, within a circumplanetary disk of gas and solid particles. We review
the formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints
and understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of
satellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final
stages of gas inflow to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would
have accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas
density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the
gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter.
Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total
satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that
multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final
stages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last
generation that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by
discussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation.

task into predicting fine-tuning performance and illustrate its natural

scaling curve includes not just the well-known ""power phase"" but also the
previously unobserved ""pre-power phase"". We also explain why existing Scaling
Law fails to capture this phase transition phenomenon both theoretically and
empirically. To address this, we introduce the concept of ""pre-learned data
size"" into our Rectified Scaling Law, which overcomes theoretical limitations
and fits experimental results much better. By leveraging our law, we propose a
novel LLM selection algorithm that selects the near-optimal model with hundreds
of times less resource consumption, while other methods may provide negatively

learn physical concepts from them. To this end, we employ multiple neural
networks to recognize the static phases (image format) and dynamical phases
(video format) of a particle-based skyrmion model. Our results show that neural
networks, without any prior knowledge, can not only correctly classify these
phases, but also predict the phase boundaries which agree with those obtained
by simulation. We further propose a parameter visualization scheme to interpret
what neural networks have learned. We show that neural networks can learn two
order parameters from videos of dynamical phases and predict the critical

parameters are needed to identify videos of skyrmion dynamical phases. It shows
that this parameter visualization scheme can be used to determine how many

which are built with tilted Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and multi-Weyl semimetals
(mWSMs), considering all possible relative orientations of the electromagnetic
fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt. The
non-Drude part of the response arises from a nonzero Berry curvature in the
vicinity of the WSM/mWSM node under consideration. Only in the presence of a
nonzero tilt do we find linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $ terms in set-ups where the
tilt-axis is not perpendicular to the plane spanned by $\mathbf E $ and $
\mathbf B $. The advantage of the emergence of the linear-in-$ | \mathbf B| $
terms is that, unlike the various $| \mathbf B|^2 $-dependent terms that can
contribute to experimental observations, they have purely a topological origin,
and they dominate the overall response-characteristics in the realistic
parameter regimes. The important signatures of these terms are that they (1)
change the periodicity of the response from $\pi $ to $2\pi$, when we consider
their dependence on the angle $\theta $ between $\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $;
and (2) lead to an overall change in sign of the conductivity depending on
$\theta$, when measured with respect to the $\mathbf B =0$ case.

analysed from the standpoint of its thermodynamical stability criteria with the
help of an equation of state, $P = - \frac{B}{\rho^{\alpha}}$, where $B =
B_{0}V^{-\frac{n}{3}}$. Here $B_{0}$ is assumed to be a positive universal
constant, $n$ is a constant parameter and $V$ is the volume of the cosmic
fluid. We get the interesting result that if the well-known stability
conditions of a fluid is adhered to, the values of $n$ are constrained to be
negative definite to make $ \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{S} <0$
\& $ \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{T} <0$ throughout the
evolution. Moreover the positivity of thermal capacity at constant volume
$c_{V}$ as also the validity of the third law of thermodynamics are ensured in
this case. For the particular case $n = 0$ the effective equation of state
reduces to $\Lambda$CDM model in the late stage of the universe while for $n
<0$ it mimics a phantom-like cosmology which is in broad agreement with the
present SNe Ia constraints like VGCG model. The thermal equation of state is
discussed and the EoS parameter is found to be an explicit function of
temperature only. Further for large volume the thermal equation of state
parameter is identical with the caloric equation of state parameter when $ T
\rightarrow 0$. It may also be mentioned that like Santos et al our model does
not admit of any critical points. We also observe that although the earlier
model of Lu explains many of the current observational findings of different
probes it fails to explain the crucial tests of thermodynamical stability.

those expected on theoretical grounds. In this paper we determine the effect of
stochastic reacceleration on the spectra of electrons in the GeV band and at
lower energies, and we investigate whether or not reacceleration can explain
the observed variation of radio spectral indices. We explicitely calculate the
momentum diffusion coefficient for 3 types of turbulence expected downstream of
the forward shock: fast-mode waves, small-scale non-resonant modes, and
large-scale modes arising from turbulent dynamo activity. Noting that
low-energy particles are efficiently coupled to the quasi-thermal plasma, a
simplified cosmic-ray transport equation can be formulated and is numerically
solved. Only fast-mode waves can provide momentum diffusion fast enough to
significantly modify the spectra of particles. Using a synchrotron emissivity
that accurately reflects a highly turbulent magnetic field, we calculate the
radio spectral index and find that soft spectra with index $\alpha\lesssim
-0.6$ can be maintained over more than 2 decades in radio frequency, even if
the electrons experience reacceleration for only one acceleration time. A
spectral hardening is possible but considerably more frequency-dependent. The
spectral modification imposed by stochastic reacceleration downstream of the
forward shock depends only weakly on the initial spectrum provided by, e.g.,
diffusive shock acceleration at the shock itself.

aggregating word embedding vectors into document embeddings. Our approach is
inspired by the Vector of Locally-Aggregated Descriptors used for image
representation, and it works as follows. First, the word embeddings gathered
from a collection of documents are clustered by k-means in order to learn a
codebook of semnatically-related word embeddings. Each word embedding is then
associated to its nearest cluster centroid (codeword). The Vector of
Locally-Aggregated Word Embeddings (VLAWE) representation of a document is then
computed by accumulating the differences between each codeword vector and each
word vector (from the document) associated to the respective codeword. We plug
the VLAWE representation, which is learned in an unsupervised manner, into a
classifier and show that it is useful for a diverse set of text classification
tasks. We compare our approach with a broad range of recent state-of-the-art
methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we
obtain a considerable improvement on the Movie Review data set, reporting an
accuracy of 93.3%, which represents an absolute gain of 10% over the

presenting the protocol design and evaluation of hyper-cellular networks
(HyCell), an SDRAN framework making base station (BS) operations globally
resource-optimized and energy-efficient (GREEN). Specifically, we first propose
a separation scheme to realize the decoupled air interface in HyCell. Then we
design a BS dispatching protocol which determines and assigns the optimal BS
for serving mobile users, and a BS sleeping protocol to improve the network
energy efficiency. Finally, we evaluate the proposed design in our HyCell
testbed. Our evaluation validates the feasibility of the proposed separation
scheme, demonstrates the effectiveness of BS dispatching, and shows great
potential in energy saving through BS sleeping control.

power-law kinetic term from reheating. For DBI kinetic term we choose monomial
potentials, $V\propto \phi^n$ with $n=2/3\,,1\,,\,2$ and $4$, and natural
inflaton potential, and for power-law kinetic term we choose quadratic, quartic
and exponential potentials. The phase of reheating can be parameterized in
terms of reheating temperature $T_{re}$, number of e-folds during reheating
$N_{re}$ and effective equation of state during reheating $w_{re}$. These
parameters can be related to the spectral index $n_s$ and other inflationary
parameters depending on the choice of inflaton kinetic term and potential. By
demanding that $w_{re}$ should have a finite range and $T_{re}$ should be above
electroweak scale, one can obtain the bounds on $n_s$ that can provide bounds
on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We find, for K-inflation with DBI kinetic term
and quadratic and quartic potentials, that the upper bound on $r$ for
physically plausible value of $0\le w_{re} \le 0.25$ is slightly larger than
the Planck-2018 and BICEP2/Keck array bound, and for $n=2/3$ and $1$, the
reheating equation of state should be less than $0$ to satisfy Planck-2018
joint constraints on $n_s$ and $r$. However, natural inflation with DBI kinetic
term is compatible with Planck-2018 bounds on $r$ and joint constraints on
$n_s$ and $r$ for physically plausible range $0 \le w_{re}\le 0.25$. The
quadratic and quartic potential with power-law kinetic term are also compatible
with Planck-2018 joint constraints on $n_s$ and $r$ for $0\le w_{re} \le 1$.
However, for exponential potential with power-law kinetic term, the equation of
state during reheating $w_{re}$ should be greater than $1$ for $r-n_s$
predictions to lie within $68\%$C.L. of joint constraints on $n_s$ and $r$ from
Planck-2018 observations.

various causal holographic observables for a given open string metric. For
analytical control, most of our calculations are performed in an asymptotically

same in higher dimensions. We also discuss how this open string metric arises

Observatory and Gemini North. With the VLBA Extragalactic Proper Motion
Catalog, we detect the secular aberration drift - the apparent motion of
extragalactic objects caused by the solar system's acceleration around the
Galactic center - at a 6.3 sigma significance. We model the aberration drift as
a spheroidal dipole, with the square root of the power equal to 4.89 +/- 0.77
muas/yr, an amplitude of 1.69 +/- 0.27 muas/yr, and an apex at (275.2 +/- 10.0

higher significance than some previous studies (e.g., Titov & Lambert 2013),
but at a lower amplitude than expected or previously measured. The full
aberration drift may be partially removed by the no-net-rotation constraint
used when measuring archival extragalactic radio source positions. Like the

the aberration drift signal should be subtracted from extragalactic proper
motions in order to detect cosmological proper motions, including the Hubble

from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has received attention in the
post-genomic era. A popular strategy has been to cluster the network into
functionally coherent groups of proteins and predict protein function from the
clusters. Traditionally, network research has focused on clustering of nodes.
However, why favor nodes over edges, when clustering of edges may be preferred?
For example, nodes belong to multiple functional groups, but clustering of
nodes typically cannot capture the group overlap, while clustering of edges
can. Clustering of adjacent edges that share many neighbors was proposed
recently, outperforming different node clustering methods. However, since some
biological processes can have characteristic ""signatures"" throughout the
network, not just locally, it may be of interest to consider edges that are not
necessarily adjacent. Hence, we design a sensitive measure of the ""topological
similarity"" of edges that can deal with edges that are not necessarily

different baker's yeast PPI networks, outperforming existing node and edge
clustering approaches.

$\Omega$ is the cosmological density parameter and $b$ is the (linear) bias
factor for optically-selected galaxies. In this paper we apply two techniques
for estimating $\beta$ from the Stromlo-APM redshift survey --- (1) measuring
the anisotropy of the redshift space correlation function in spherical
harmonics and (2) comparing the amplitude of the direction-averaged redshift
space correlation function to the real space correlation function. We test the
validity of these techniques, particularly whether the assumption of linear
theory is justified, using two sets of large $N$-body simulations. We find that
the first technique is affected by non-linearities on scales up to $\sim 30
\hMpc$. The second technique is less sensitive to non-linear effects and so is
more useful for existing redshift surveys. The Stromlo-APM survey data favours
a low value for $\beta$, with $\beta \simlt 0.6$. A bias parameter $b \approx
2$ is thus required if $\Omega \equiv 1$. However, higher-order correlations
measured from the APM galaxy survey (Gazta\~{n}aga and Frieman 1994) indicate a
low value for the bias parameter $b \approx 1$, requiring that $\Omega \simlt
0.5$. We also measure the relative bias for samples of galaxies of various
luminosity and morphological type and find that low-luminosity galaxies are
roughly three times less biased than $L^*$ galaxies. For the galaxy population
as a whole, we measure a real space variance of galaxy counts in $8 \hMpc$
spheres of $(\sigma^2_8)_g = 0.89 \pm 0.05$.

belt analog, and an inner disk of warm dust. Spitzer/IRS measurements indicate
that the warm dust is present at distances as close as a few AU from the star.
Its origin is puzzling, since an ""asteroid belt"" that could produce this dust
would be unstable because of the known inner planet. Aims: Here we test the
hypothesis that the observed warm dust is generated by collisions in the outer
belt and is transported inward by Poynting-Robertson (P-R) drag and strong
stellar winds. Methods: We simulated a steady-state distribution of dust
particles outside 10AU with a collisional code and in the inner region (r<10AU)
with single-particle numerical integrations. By assuming homogeneous spherical
dust grains composed of water ice and silicate, we calculated the thermal
emission of the dust and compared it with observations. We investigated two
different orbital configurations for the inner planet inferred from RV
measurements, one with a highly eccentric orbit of e=0.7 and another one with a
moderate one of e=0.25. We also produced a simulation without a planet.
Results: Our models can reproduce the shape and magnitude of the observed SED
from mid-IR to sub-mm wavelengths, as well as the Spitzer/MIPS radial
brightness profiles. The best-fit dust composition includes both ice and
silicates. The results are similar for the two possible planetary orbits and
without a planet. Conclusions: The observed warm dust in the system can indeed
stem from the outer belt and be transported inward by P-R and stellar wind
drag. The inner planet has little effect on the distribution of dust, so that
the planetary orbit could not be constrained. Reasonable agreement between the
model and observations can only be achieved by relaxing the assumption of
purely silicate dust and assuming a mixture of silicate and ice in comparable
amounts.

  Learning",This paper has been accepted by KDD 2021,,,,cs.LG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) as an emerging technique have
shown superior capacity of dealing with heterogeneous information network
(HIN). However, most HGNNs follow a semi-supervised learning manner, which
notably limits their wide use in reality since labels are usually scarce in
real applications. Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method,
becomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential
when there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of
self-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for
HGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only
focuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs
cross-viewcontrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network
schema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to
capture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the
cross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed,
which is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views.
This enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally
learn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, two extensions of HeCo are designed
to generate harder negative samples with high quality, which further boosts the
performance of HeCo. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world
networks show the superior performance of the proposed methods over the
state-of-the-arts.

reliability and safety of deep learning. Currently, discriminator models
outperform other methods in this regard. However, the feature extraction
process used by discriminator models suffers from the loss of critical
information, leaving room for bad cases and malicious attacks. In this paper,
we introduce a new perceptron bias assumption that suggests discriminator
models are more sensitive to certain features of the input, leading to the
overconfidence problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
that combines discriminator and generation models and integrates diffusion
models (DMs) into OOD detection. We demonstrate that the diffusion denoising
process (DDP) of DMs serves as a novel form of asymmetric interpolation, which
is well-suited to enhance the input and mitigate the overconfidence problem.
The discriminator model features of OOD data exhibit sharp changes under DDP,
and we utilize the norm of this change as the indicator score. Our experiments
on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet show that our method outperforms SOTA
approaches. Notably, for the challenging InD ImageNet and OOD species datasets,
our method achieves an AUROC of 85.7, surpassing the previous SOTA method's

resonant-cavity mode in the same vein as refractive-index of gain medium inside
the cavity. Reversible, continuous, and mode-hop-free tuning of ~57GHz is
realized for single-mode narrow-beam terahertz plasmonic quantum-cascade lasers
(QCLs), which is demonstrated at much more practical temperature of 78K. The
tuning is based on post-process deposition/etching of a dielectric
(Silicon-dioxide) on a QCL chip that has already been soldered and wire-bonded
onto a copper mount. This is a considerably larger tuning range compared to
previously reported results for terahertz QCLs with directional far-field
radiation patterns. The key enabling mechanism for tuning is a recently
developed antenna-feedback scheme for plasmonic lasers, which leads to
generation of hybrid surface-plasmon-polaritons propagating outside the cavity
of the laser with a large spatial extent. The effect of dielectric deposition
on QCL's characteristics is investigated in detail including that on maximum
operating temperature, peak output power and far-field radiation patterns.
Single-lobed beam with low divergence (<7deg) is maintained through the tuning
range. The antenna-feedback scheme is ideally suited for modulation of
plasmonic lasers and their sensing applications due to the sensitive dependence
of spectral and radiative properties of the laser on its surrounding medium.

from only a few optical spectra, the most important of which was seriously
affected by a CCD defect. Here we present new spectra of the WR star, spanning
one month, obtained with the Keck-I 10 m telescope. The spectra show a periodic
shift in the He II 4686 Ang. emission line as compared with IC 10 nebular lines

line energy distribution (SLED) at $z = 6.003$, and analyzed it with the

gas density $log (n(\rm H_{2})/\rm cm^{-3}$ )=4.75, and CO column density
$log(N(\rm CO)/\rm cm^{-2}) =17.5$, although a two-component model better fits
the data. In either case, the CO SLED is dominated by a ""warm"" and ""dense""
component. Compared to samples of local (Ultra) Luminous Infrared Galaxies
((U)LIRGs), starburst galaxies and high redshift Submillimeter Galaxies (SMGs),
J2310+1855 exhibits higher CO excitation at ($J \geq 8$), like other high
redshift quasars. The high CO excitation, together with the enhanced $L_{\rm
H_{2}O}/ L_{IR} $, $L_{\rm H_{2}O}/ L_{CO} $ and $L_{OH^{+}}/L_{\rm H_{2}O} $
ratios, suggests that besides the UV radiation from young massive stars, other
mechanisms such as shocks, cosmic rays and X-rays might also be responsible for
the heating and ionization of the molecular gas. In the nuclear region probed
by the molecular emissions lines, any of these mechanisms might be present due
to the powerful quasar and the starburst activity.

accelerating through the inertial vacuum with a constant acceleration $g$, will
behave as though it is immersed in a radiation field with temperature
$T=(g/2\pi)$. We study a generalization of this result for detectors moving
with a time-dependent acceleration $g(\tau)$ along a given direction. After
defining the rate of excitation of the detector appropriately, we evaluate this
rate for time-dependent acceleration, $g(\tau)$, to linear order in the
parameter $\eta = \dot g / g^2$. In this case, we have three length scales in
the problem: $g^{-1}, (\dot g/g)^{-1}$ and $\omega^{-1}$ where $\omega$ is the
energy difference between the two levels of the detector at which the spectrum
is probed. We show that: (a) When $\omega^{-1} \ll g^{-1} \ll (\dot g/g)^{-1}$,
the rate of transition of the detector corresponds to a slowly varying
temperature $T(\tau) = g(\tau)/2 \pi $, as one would have expected. (b)
However, when $ g^{-1}\ll \omega^{-1} \ll (\dot g/g)^{-1}$, we find that the
spectrum is modified \textit{even at the order $\mathcal{O}(\eta)$}. This is
counter-intuitive because, in this case, the relevant frequency does not probe
the rate of change of the acceleration since $(\dot g/g) \ll \omega$ and we
certainly do not have deviation from the thermal spectrum when $\dot g =0$.
This result shows that there is a subtle discontinuity in the behaviour of
detectors with $\dot g = 0$ and $\dot g/g^2$ being arbitrarily small. We
corroborate this result by evaluating the detector response for a particular
trajectory which admits an analytic expression for the poles of the Wightman
function.

has been proposed due to the unique temperature invariant sound velocity

The sound velocity of liquid Bi was measured into the supercooled region to
high accuracy and it was found to be invariant over a temperature range of ca.
60 degrees, from 35 degrees above the melting point to ca. 25 degrees into the
supercooled region. The structural origin of this phenomenon was explored by
neutron diffraction structural measurements in the supercooled temperature

the CASTRO code, which incorporates truly multi-dimensional, multi-group,
flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport, including all relevant
$\mathcal{O}(v/c)$ terms. Our main motivation for carrying out this study is to
compare with recent 2D models produced by other groups who have obtained
explosions for some progenitor stars and with recent 2D VULCAN results that did
not incorporate $\mathcal{O}(v/c)$ terms. We follow the evolution of 12, 15,
20, and 25 solar-mass progenitors to approximately 600 milliseconds after
bounce and do not obtain an explosion in any of these models. Though the reason
for the qualitative disagreement among the groups engaged in CCSN modeling
remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying ``ray-by-ray' approach
employed by all other groups may be compromising their results. We show that
``ray-by-ray' calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal
variations of the neutrino fluxes, which we argue are better captured by our
multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On the other hand, our 2D models also make
approximations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions concerning
the root of the differences between groups. We discuss some of the diagnostics
often employed in the analyses of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate
relationship between the various explosion conditions that have been proposed.
Finally, we explore the ingredients that may be missing in current calculations
that may be important in reproducing the properties of the average CCSNe,
should the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism be the correct mechanism of
explosion.

In total, seven of the systems reported here rank among the nearest 100 stellar
systems. Supporting photometric and spectroscopic observations have been made
to provide full characterization of the systems, including complete VRIJHK

six obvious variable stars, including GJ 1207, for which we observed a flare
event in the V band that caused it to brighten by 1.7 mag.

that they are beyond 10 pc. From the analysis of systems with (previously) high

excess of 10 mas are insufficiently reliable for inclusion in the RECONS

correct-by-construction systems that interact with an unknown or adversarial
environment. We study how to do reactive synthesis when part of the
specification of the system is that its behavior should be random. Randomness
can be useful, for example, in a network protocol fuzz tester whose output
should be varied, or a planner for a surveillance robot whose route should be
unpredictable. However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a
way to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards
this end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control
improvisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive
control improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness
requirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over
a finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are
realizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications
given by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our
method yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm. For various other types of
specifications including temporal logic formulas, we obtain a polynomial-space
algorithm and prove matching PSPACE-hardness results. We show that all of these
randomized variants of reactive synthesis are no harder in a
complexity-theoretic sense than their non-randomized counterparts.

heating), taking into account differential constraints on chaotic flows. We
find that the period of ideal evolution is roughly doubled over an estimate
without constraints. The helicity generation terms are exponentially smaller
than the energy dissipation, so that large quantities of energy are dissipated
before any helicity can be created. Helicity flow is exponentially larger than
net helicity generation. The constraints also lead to the existence of a
singular initial condition for the magnetic field for which sizable amounts of

five-qubit code drastically increases the effective memory coherence time,
reducing a phase flip probability of $1\%$ to $0.001\%$ when employing an error
syndrome identification adapted to the quantum noise channel. Furthermore, it
mitigates the impact of faulty Bell state measurements and imperfect state
preparation, lowering the minimally required depolarization parameter for
non-zero secret key rates in an eight-segment repeater from $98.4\%$ to
$96.4\%$. As a result, the memory-corrected quantum repeater can often generate
secret keys in experimental parameter regimes where the unencoded repeater
fails to produce a secret key. In an eight-segment repeater, one can even
achieve non-vanishing secret key rates up to distances of 2000 km for memory
coherence times of $t_c = 10$ s or less using multiplexing. Assuming a
zero-distance link-coupling efficiency $p_0 = 0.7$, a depolarization parameter
$\mu = 0.99$, $t_c = 10$ s, and an 800 km total repeater length, we obtain a
secret key rate of 4.85 Hz, beating both the unencoded repeater that provides
1.25 Hz and ideal twin-field quantum key distribution with 0.71 Hz at GHz clock
rates.

simulation of laboratory experiments in which the heating/cooling rate is

problem (MBT) in directed and undirected graphs. The goal in MBT is to find a
maximum-sized binary tree in a given graph. MBT is a natural variant of the
well-studied longest path problem, since both can be viewed as finding a
maximum-sized tree of bounded degree in a given graph.
  The connection to longest path motivates the study of MBT in directed acyclic
graphs (DAGs), since the longest path problem is solvable efficiently in DAGs.
In contrast, we show that MBT in DAGs is in fact hard: it has no efficient
$\exp(-O(\log n/ \log \log n))$-approximation algorithm under the exponential
time hypothesis, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. In
undirected graphs, we show that MBT has no efficient
$\exp(-O(\log^{0.63}{n}))$-approximation under the exponential time hypothesis.
Our inapproximability results rely on self-improving reductions and structural
properties of binary trees. We also show constant-factor inapproximability
assuming $\text{P}\neq \text{NP}$.
  In addition to inapproximability results, we present algorithmic results
along two different flavors: (1) We design a randomized algorithm to verify if
a given directed graph on $n$ vertices contains a binary tree of size $k$ in
$2^k \text{poly}(n)$ time. (2) Motivated by the longest heapable subsequence
problem, introduced by Byers, Heeringa, Mitzenmacher, and Zervas (ANALCO 2011),

  Enhancement and Robust ASR",in submission,,,,eess.AS eess.SP,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is based on
supervised learning by using simulated training data. The trained models,
however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded data. To
address this, we investigate training models directly on real target-domain
data, and propose two algorithms, mixture-to-mixture (M2M) training and a
co-learning algorithm that improves M2M with the help of supervised algorithms.
When paired close-talk and far-field mixtures are available for training, M2M
realizes speech enhancement by training a deep neural network (DNN) to produce
speech and noise estimates in a way such that they can be linearly filtered to
reconstruct the close-talk and far-field mixtures. This way, the DNN can be
trained directly on real mixtures, and can leverage close-talk mixtures as a
weak supervision to enhance far-field mixtures. To improve M2M, we combine it
with supervised approaches to co-train the DNN, where mini-batches of real
close-talk and far-field mixture pairs and mini-batches of simulated mixture
and clean speech pairs are alternately fed to the DNN, and the loss functions
are respectively (a) the mixture reconstruction loss on the real close-talk and
far-field mixtures and (b) the regular enhancement loss on the simulated clean
speech and noise. We find that, this way, the DNN can learn from real and
simulated data to achieve better generalization to real data. We name this
algorithm SuperME, $\underline{super}$vised and
$\underline{m}$ixture-to-mixtur$\underline{e}$ co-learning. Evaluation results
on the CHiME-4 dataset show its effectiveness and potential.

online scheduling. The goal is to assign a sequence of jobs to $m$ identical
parallel machines so as to minimize the maximum completion time of any job.
Already in the 1960s, Graham showed that Greedy is $(2-1/m)$-competitive. The
best deterministic online algorithm currently known achieves a competitive
ratio of 1.9201. No deterministic online strategy can obtain a competitiveness
smaller than 1.88.
  In this paper, we study online makespan minimization in the popular
random-order model, where the jobs of a given input arrive as a random
permutation. It is known that Greedy does not attain a competitive factor
asymptotically smaller than 2 in this setting. We present the first improved
performance guarantees. Specifically, we develop a deterministic online
algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 1.8478. The result relies on a
new analysis approach. We identify a set of properties that a random
permutation of the input jobs satisfies with high probability. Then we conduct
a worst-case analysis of our algorithm, for the respective class of
permutations. The analysis implies that the stated competitiveness holds not
only in expectation but with high probability. Moreover, it provides
mathematical evidence that job sequences leading to higher performance ratios
are extremely rare, pathological inputs. We complement the results by lower
bounds, for the random-order model. We show that no deterministic online
algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than 4/3. Moreover, no
deterministic online algorithm can attain a competitiveness smaller than 3/2
with high probability.

transfer it to our annotated financial social media data. Our model outperforms
competing open-source state-of-the-art emotion classifiers, such as Emotion

to dictionary based methods, our methodology has three main advantages for
research in finance. First, our model is tailored to financial social media

non-standard phrases, emojis, and emoticons; and third, it operates by
sequentially learning a latent representation that includes features such as

  Language Models",preprint,,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,"  Since Large Language Models or LLMs have demonstrated high-quality
performance on many complex language tasks, there is a great interest in
bringing these LLMs to mobile devices for faster responses and better privacy
protection. However, the size of LLMs (i.e., billions of parameters) requires
highly effective compression to fit into storage-limited devices. Among many
compression techniques, weight-clustering, a form of non-linear quantization,
is one of the leading candidates for LLM compression, and supported by modern
smartphones. Yet, its training overhead is prohibitively significant for LLM
fine-tuning. Especially, Differentiable KMeans Clustering, or DKM, has shown
the state-of-the-art trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy
regression, but its large memory complexity makes it nearly impossible to apply
to train-time LLM compression. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient DKM
implementation, eDKM powered by novel techniques to reduce the memory footprint
of DKM by orders of magnitudes. For a given tensor to be saved on CPU for the
backward pass of DKM, we compressed the tensor by applying uniquification and
sharding after checking if there is no duplicated tensor previously copied to
CPU. Our experimental results demonstrate that \prjname can fine-tune and
compress a pretrained LLaMA 7B model from 12.6 GB to 2.5 GB (3bit/weight) with
the Alpaca dataset by reducing the train-time memory footprint of a decoder
layer by 130$\times$, while delivering good accuracy on broader LLM benchmarks
(i.e., 77.7% for PIQA, 66.1% for Winograde, and so on).

overfitting. Although our experiment is in the optical domain, our method

method to achieve this is by extracting the damping wing signal from the

determining the detailed time evolution of the ionization fraction with
unprecedented fidelity. However, traditional approaches to parameter inference
are not sufficiently accurate. We assess the performance of a simulation-based
inference (SBI) method to infer the neutral fraction of the universe from
quasar spectra. The SBI method adeptly exploits the shape information of the
damping wing, enabling precise estimations of the neutral fraction
$\left<x_{\rm HI}\right>_{\rm v}$ and the wing position $w_p$. Importantly, the
SBI framework successfully breaks the degeneracy between these two parameters,
offering unbiased estimates of both. This makes the SBI superior to the
traditional method using a pseudo-likelihood function. We anticipate that SBI
will be essential to determine robustly the ionization history of the Universe
through joint inference from the hundreds of high-$z$ spectra we will observe.

planetary climate and habitability is critical for us to search for a habitable
world beyond our solar system. The orbital configurations of M-dwarf planets
are always tidally-locked at resonance states, which are quite different from
those around Sun-like stars. M-dwarf planets need to be investigated
separately. Here we use a comprehensive three-dimensional atmospheric general
circulation model to systematically investigate how eccentricity influences
climate and habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets. The simulation results show
that (1) the seasonal climatic cycles of such planets are very weak even for e
= 0.4. It is unlikely that an aqua planet falls out of a habitable zone during
its orbit. (2) The annual global mean surface temperature significantly
increases with increased eccentricity, due to the decrease of the cloud albedo.
Both the runaway greenhouse inner edge and moist greenhouse inner edge shift
outward. (3) Planets in an eccentric orbit can be captured in other spin-orbit
resonance states which lead to different climate patterns, namely eyeball
pattern and striped-ball pattern.The striped-ball pattern has evidently higher
surface temperatures due to the reduced planetary albedo. Near the outer edge,
planets with p = 1.0 and 2.0 are more resistant to the snowball state due to
more locally-concentrated stellar fluxes. Thus, planets with integer spin-orbit
resonance numbers have wider habitable zones than those with half-integer
spin-orbit resonance states. Above all, as a comparison to circular orbit,
eccentricity shrinks the width of the habitable zone.

generations in the $H\to ZZ$ final states. Deviation of these couplings from
the Standard Model values leads to change in the Higgs boson width and in the

increased light Yukawa coupling leads to an increased Higgs boson width, which
in turn leads to a decreased cross section. In the off-shell region, increased
Yukawa couplings result in an enhancement of the Higgs boson signal through
$q\bar{q}$ annihilation. With the assumption of scaling one Yukawa coupling at
a time, this study is conceptually simple and yields results with the same
order of magnitude as the tightest in the literature. The study is based on

by practical storage applications. LDPCL codes (suffix L represents locality)

locally when a smaller sub-block is accessed (to reduce latency). LDPCL codes
are designed to maximize the error-correction performance vs. rate in the usual

local mode. We develop a theoretical framework for the design of LDPCL codes.
Our results include a design tool to construct an LDPC code with two
data-protection levels: local and global. We derive theoretical results
supporting this tool and we show how to achieve capacity with it. A trade-off
between the gap to capacity and the number of full-block accesses is studied,
and a finite-length analysis of ML decoding is performed to exemplify a
trade-off between the locality capability and the full-block error-correcting
capability.

the available gold-standard datasets may be too small to extrapolate. As the
use of inherently fallible crowds becomes more prevalent in data cleaning
problems, it is important to have estimators to quantify the extent of such
errors. We propose novel species estimators to estimate the number of distinct
remaining errors in a dataset after it has been cleaned by a set of crowd
workers -- essentially, quantifying the utility of hiring additional workers to
clean the dataset. This problem requires new estimators that are robust to
false positives and false negatives, and we empirically show on three
real-world datasets that existing species estimators are unstable for this
problem, while our proposed techniques quickly converge.

different applications. PyConv has the potential to impact nearly every

important implications for reliable physical discovery. Traditional methods are
either insufficient to cope with the heterogeneous nature of uncertainty or
inadequate to perform well with unknown mathematical models. In this paper, we
propose using multi-layer convolutional neural networks for empirical
uncertainty estimation and feature extraction of nuclear pulse signals. This
method is based on deep learning, a recent development of machine learning
techniques, which learns the desired mapping function from training data and
generalizes to unseen test data. Furthermore, ensemble learning is utilized to
estimate the uncertainty originating from trainable parameters of the network
and to improve the robustness of the whole model. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed method, simulation studies, in comparison with curve fitting,
investigate extensive conditions and show its universal applicability. Finally,
a case study is made using data from a NICA-MPD electromagnetic calorimeter
module exposed to a test beam at DESY, Germany. The uncertainty estimation
method successfully detected out-of-distribution samples and also achieved good
accuracy in time and energy measurements.

ago by Burkardt and introduce a new transverse correlation, namely between
quark transversity and orbital angular momentum. We also provide for the first
time the Wandzura-Wilczek expression for the second Mellin moment of twist-3
transversity generalized parton distributions, along with a new sum rule. Based
on lattice calculation results, we conclude that the quark transverse

  Gaussian Interference Channel","63 pages, 7 figures, part of it accepted in ISIT 2011 and IEEE
  Transactions on Communications",,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The K-user symmetric multiple input multiple output (MIMO) Gaussian
interference channel (IC) where each transmitter has M antennas and each
receiver has N antennas is studied from a generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF)
perspective. An inner bound on the GDOF is derived using a combination of
techniques such as treating interference as noise, zero forcing (ZF) at the
receivers, interference alignment (IA), and extending the Han-Kobayashi (HK)
scheme to K users, as a function of the number of antennas and the log (INR) /
log (SNR) level. Three outer bounds are derived, under different assumptions of
cooperation and providing side information to receivers. The novelty in the
derivation lies in the careful selection of side information, which results in
the cancellation of the negative differential entropy terms containing signal
components, leading to a tractable outer bound. The overall outer bound is
obtained by taking the minimum of the three outer bounds. The derived bounds
are simplified for the MIMO Gaussian symmetric IC to obtain outer bounds on the
generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF). Several interesting conclusions are
drawn from the derived bounds. For example, when K > N/M + 1, a combination of
the HK and IA schemes performs the best among the schemes considered. When N/M
< K <= N/M + 1, the HK-scheme outperforms other schemes and is shown to be GDOF
optimal. In addition, when the SNR and INR are at the same level, ZF-receiving
and the HK-scheme have the same GDOF performance. It is also shown that many of
the existing results on the GDOF of the Gaussian IC can be obtained as special
cases of the bounds, e.g., by setting K=2 or the number of antennas at each
user to 1.

integrals over closed spatial surfaces. The expression readily leads to
formulas for the number of photons, energy, and helicity of generic
polychromatic light pulses of incoming or outgoing character. The capabilities
of popular Maxwell solvers in spatially-bounded computational domains are
thereby augmented, for example, by a straightforward method for normalizing
emitted fields so that they contain a single photon.

0{\deg}-6{\deg} and excitation energies 6-22 MeV. Cross sections due to E1 and
M1 excitations were extracted with a multipole decomposition analysis and then
converted to reduced transition probabilities with the ""virtual photon method""
for E1 and the ""unit cross section method"" for M1 excitations, respectively.
Including a theory-aided correction for the high excitation energy region not
covered experimentally, the electric dipole polarizability was determined from
the E1 strength distributions. Total photoabsorption cross sections derived
from the E1 and M1 strength distributions show significant differences compared
to those from previous ($\gamma$,xn) experiments in the energy region of the
isocvector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR). The widths of the IVGDR deduced from
the present data with a Lorentz parameterization show an approximately constant
value of about 4.5 MeV in contrast to the large variations between isotopes
observed in previous work. The IVGDR centroid energies are in good
correspondence to expectations from systematics of their mass dependence.
Furthermore, a study of the dependence of the IVGDR energies on bulk matter
properties is presented. The E1 strengths below neutron threshold show fair
agreement with results from ($\gamma$,$\gamma$') experiments on
112,116,120,124Sn in the energy region between 6 and 7 MeV. At higher
excitation energies large differences are observed pointing to a different
nature of the excited states with small ground state branching ratios. The
isovector spin-M1 strengths exhibit a broad distribution between 6 and 12 MeV
in all studied nuclei.

failure time for each patient but also a sequence of measurements on patient
health at annual or semi-annual check-ups while the patient remains alive. Such
a sequence of random length accompanied by a survival time is called a survival
process. Ordinarily robust health is associated with longer survival, so the
two parts of a survival process cannot be assumed independent. This paper is
concerned with a general technique---time reversal---for constructing
statistical models for survival processes. A revival model is a regression
model in the sense that it incorporates covariate and treatment effects into
both the distribution of survival times and the joint distribution of health
outcomes. It also allows individual health outcomes to be used clinically for
predicting the subsequent survival time.

structural-phase-field-crystal (XPFC) model with a ballistic driving force to
describe such a process, with the specific example of the growth of gold
nanoparticles in a two component mixture. The reaction path is described in the
context of free energy landscape of the model, and dynamical simulations are
performed based on phenomenological model parameters closely corresponding to
the experimental conditions, so as to draw conclusions on nanoparticle growth
dynamics. It is shown that the ballistic term lowers the activation energy
barrier of reaction, enabling the reaction in a temperature regime compatible
with experimental observations. The model also explains the mechanism of
precipitated grain size reduction that is consistent with experimental
observations. Our simulation results afford novel mechanistic insights into
mechanosynthesis with implications for nanaparticle production and beyond.

  Machine Learning in Military Settings",9 pages. To be published in MILCOM 2022,,,,cs.LG cs.DC,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,"  Distributed machine learning (DML) can be an important capability for modern
military to take advantage of data and devices distributed at multiple vantage
points to adapt and learn. The existing distributed machine learning
frameworks, however, cannot realize the full benefits of DML, because they are
all based on the simple linear aggregation framework, but linear aggregation
cannot handle the $\textit{divergence challenges}$ arising in military
settings: the learning data at different devices can be heterogeneous
($\textit{i.e.}$, Non-IID data), leading to model divergence, but the ability
for devices to communicate is substantially limited ($\textit{i.e.}$, weak
connectivity due to sparse and dynamic communications), reducing the ability
for devices to reconcile model divergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel
DML framework called aggregation in the mirror space (AIMS) that allows a DML
system to introduce a general mirror function to map a model into a mirror
space to conduct aggregation and gradient descent. Adapting the convexity of
the mirror function according to the divergence force, AIMS allows automatic
optimization of DML. We conduct both rigorous analysis and extensive
experimental evaluations to demonstrate the benefits of AIMS. For example, we
prove that AIMS achieves a loss of
$O\left((\frac{m^{r+1}}{T})^{\frac1r}\right)$ after $T$ network-wide updates,
where $m$ is the number of devices and $r$ the convexity of the mirror
function, with existing linear aggregation frameworks being a special case with
$r=2$. Our experimental evaluations using EMANE (Extendable Mobile Ad-hoc
Network Emulator) for military communications settings show similar results:
AIMS can improve DML convergence rate by up to 57\% and scale well to more
devices with weak connectivity, all with little additional computation overhead
compared to traditional linear aggregation.

  manuscript. MNRAS in press",,10.1093/mnras/stw1867,,astro-ph.GA physics.space-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are the smallest known stellar systems where under
Newtonian interpretations, a significant amount of dark matter is required to
explain observed kinematics. In fact, they are in this sense the most heavily
dark matter dominated objects known. That, plus the increasingly small sizes of
the newly discovered ultra faint dwarfs, puts these systems in the regime where
dynamical friction on individual stars starts to become relevant. We calculate
the dynamical friction timescales for pressure supported isotropic spherical
dark matter dominated stellar systems, yielding $\tau_{DF} =0.93 (r_{h}/10
pc)^{2} (\sigma/ kms^{-1}) Gyr$, { where $r_{h}$ is the half-light radius}. For
a stellar velocity dispersion value of $3 km/s$, as typical for the smallest of
the recently detected ultra faint dwarf spheroidals, dynamical friction
timescales becomes smaller than the $10 Gyr$ typical of the stellar ages for
these systems, for $r_{h}<19 pc$. Thus, this becomes a theoretical lower limit
below which dark matter dominated stellar systems become unstable to dynamical
friction. We present a comparison with structural parameters of the smallest
ultra faint dwarf spheroidals known, showing that these are already close to
the stability limit derived, any future detection of yet smaller such systems
would be inconsistent with a particle dark matter hypothesis.

semi-Dirac material under the influence of an external time dependent periodic
driving field (irradiation) by means of Floquet theory. We explore the
inelastic scattering mechanism between different side-bands, induced by
irradiation, by using Floquet scattering matrix approach. The scattering
probabilities between two nearest side-bands depend monotonically on the
strength of the amplitude of the irradiation. The external irradiation induces
gap into the band dispersion which is strongly dependent on the angular
orientation of momentum. Although, the high frequency limit indicates that the
gap opening does not occur in an irradiated semi-Dirac material, a careful
analysis of the full band structure beyond this limit reveals that gap opening
indeed appears for higher values of momentum (away from the Dirac point).
Furthermore, the angular dependent dynamical gap is also present which cannot
be captured within the high frequency approximation. The contrasting features
of irradiated semi-Dirac material, in comparison to irradiated graphene, can be
probed via the behavior of conductance. The latter exhibits the appearance of
non-zero conductance dips due to the gap opening in Floquet band spectrum.
Moreover, by considering a nanoribbon geometry of such material, we also show
that it can host a pair of edge modes which are fully decoupled from the bulk,
which is in contrast to the case of graphene nanoribbon where the edge modes
are coupled to the bulk. We also investigate that if the nanoribbon of this
material is exposed to the external irradiation, decoupled edge modes penetrate
into the bulk.

phenomenon found across many branches of science. From an application point of
view, while the multirhythmicity is sometimes desirable as it presents us with
many possible coexisting stable oscillatory states to tap into, it can also be
a nuisance because a random perturbation may make the system settle onto an
unwanted stable state. Consequently, it is not surprising that there are many
natural and artificial mechanisms available that can control the
multirhythmicity. We propose in this paper the idea of incorporating parametric
(periodic) modulation of the nonlinear damping in the limit cycle oscillators
with a view to exciting resonance and antiresonance responses at particular
angular driving frequencies, and controlling the resulting birhythmicity by
changing the amplitude of the modulation. To this end, we employ analytical
(perturbative) and numerical techniques on the van der Pol oscillator---a
paradigmatic limit cycle system---having additional position dependent time
delay term and its modified autonomous birhythmic version. We also bring the
fact to the fore that introduction of delay---a commonly adopted method of
controlling multirhythmicity---in such a system can sometimes bring forth
unwanted birhythmicity; and interestingly, our method of controlling
birhythmicity through periodic modulation can suppress such a delay induced
birhythmic response.

gravitational influence of the planets has a non-negligible effect on the
causes of the solar magnetic cycle. In this work we looked for a possible
causal link in relation with solar barycentric dynamics and prolonged minima
events. We searched for particular changes in the Sun's acceleration and
concentrated on long-term variations of the solar cycle. We show how the
orbital angular momentum of the Sun evolves and how the inclination of the
solar barycentric orbit varies during the epochs of orbital retrogressions. In
particular, at these moments, the radial component of the Sun's acceleration
(i.e., in the barycentre-Sun direction) had an exceptional magnitude. These
radial impulses occurred at the very beginning of the Maunder Minimum, during
the Dalton Minimum and also at the maximum of cycle 22 before the present
extended minimum. We also found a strong correlation between the planetary
torque and the observed sunspots international number around that maximum. We
apply our results in a novel theory of Sun-planets interaction that it is
sensitive to Sun barycentric dynamics and found a very important effect on the
Sun's capability of storing hypothetical reservoirs of potential energy that
could be released by internal flows and might be related to the solar cycle.
This process begins about 40 years before the solar angular momentum
inversions, i.e., before Maunder Minimum, Dalton Minimum, and before the
present extended minimum. Our conclusions suggest a dynamical characterization
of peculiar prolonged solar minima. We discuss the possible implications of
these results for the solar cycle including the present extended minimum.

failure issues of underwater sensor networks by proposing an energy-efficient
hierarchical topology-aware clustering routing (EEHTAC) protocol. In this
paper, fault-tolerant backup clustering (FTBC) algorithms and multi-parameter
cluster formation (MPCF) model were developed for the EEHTAC operation. The
MPCF model tackles the issue of poor cluster formation performance by
integrating multiple parameters to achieve effective clustering process. The
FTBC algorithms tackle the issue of frequent CH failures to avoid interruption
in data transmission. Performance of the MPCF model was evaluated using normal,
high-fault, and high routing overhead network scenarios. Performance metrics
employed for this analysis are temporal topology variation ratio (TTVR), CH
load distribution (CLD), and cluster stability (STB). Obtained results show
that operating with a CH retention period of 90s achieves better CH duty
cycling per round and improves the MPCF process with values of 25.69%, 55.56%,
and 60% for TTVR, CLD, and STB respectively. Performance of the FTBC-based
EEHTAC was evaluated relative to Energy-balanced Unequal Layering Clustering
(EULC) protocol. Performance indicators adopted for this evaluation are routing
overhead ({\Omega}), end to end delay ({\Delta}), CH failures recovered (CFR),
CH failures detected (CFD), received packets ({\theta}), and energy consumption
({\Sigma}). With reference to the best obtained values, EEHTAC demonstrated
performance improvement of 58.40%, 29.94%, 81.33%, 28.02%, 86.65%, and 54.35%
over EULC variants in terms of {\Omega}, {\Delta}, CFR, CFD, {\theta}, and

can perform effectively well against an existing CBR protocol.

uncertainties in excess variance which accounts both for measurement
uncertainties and for the stochastic nature of the variability. We also present
an analytical method to predict the excess variance from a model power spectrum
accounting for binning, sampling and windowing effects. Using this, we modelled
the variance-mass relation assuming all objects have a universal twice-broken
power spectrum, with the position of the breaks being dependent on mass. This
accounts for the general form of the relationship but there is considerable
scatter. We investigated this scatter as a function of the X-ray photon index,
luminosity and Eddington ratio. After accounting for the dependence of excess
variance on mass, we find no significant correlation with either luminosity or
X-ray spectral slope. We do find an anti-correlation between excess variance
and the Eddington ratio, although this relation might be an artifact owing to
the uncertainties in the mass measurements. It remains to be established that
enhanced X-ray variability is a property of objects with steep X-ray slopes or
large Eddington ratios.

We infer the physical parameters of chromospheric plasmas from these lines
using a multilayer spectral inversion. This is a new technique of spectral
inversion. We assume that the atmosphere consists of a finite number of layers.
In each layer the absorption profile is constant and the source function varies
with optical depth with a constant gradient. Specifically, we consider a
three-layer model of radiative transfer where the lowest layer is identified
with the photosphere and the two upper layers are identified with the
chromosphere. The absorption profile in the photosphere is described by a Voigt
function, and the profile in the chromosphere by a Gaussian function. This
three-layer model is fully specified by 13 parameters. Four parameters can be
fixed to prescribed values, and one parameter can be determined from the
analysis of a satellite photospheric line. The remaining 8 parameters are
determined from a constrained least-squares fitting. We applied the multilayer
spectral inversion to the spectral data of the H$\alpha$ and the Ca II 854.21
nm lines taken in a quiet region by the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS)
of the Goode Solar Telescope (GST). We find that our model successfully fits
most of the observed profiles and produces regular maps of the model
parameters. The combination of the inferred Doppler widths of the two lines
yields reasonable estimates of temperature and nonthermal speed in the

Based Services (LBSs) have become an important part of their life. It is
possible for malicious parties having access to geolocation data to learn
sensitive information about the user such as religion or political views.
Location Privacy Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed by previous
works to ensure the privacy of the shared data while allowing the users to use
LBSs. But there is no clear view of which mechanism to use according to the
scenario in which the user makes use of a LBS. The scenario is the way the user
is using a LBS (frequency of reports, number of reports). In this paper, we
study the sensitivity of LPPMs on the scenario on which they are used. We
propose a framework to systematically evaluate LPPMs by considering an
exhaustive combination of LPPMs, attacks and metrics. Using our framework we
compare a selection of LPPMs including an improved mechanism that we introduce.
By evaluating over a variety of scenarios, we find that the efficacy (privacy,
utility, and robustness) of the studied mechanisms is dependent on the
scenario: for example the privacy of Planar Laplace geo-indistinguishability is
greatly reduced in a continuous scenario. We show that the scenario is
essential to consider when choosing an obfuscation mechanism for a given
application.

automatic generation of counter narratives by adapting Pretrained
Transformer-based Language Models (PLMs) with human-curated data. This process,
however, can produce in-domain overfitting, resulting in models generating
acceptable narratives only for hatred similar to training data, with little
portability to other targets or to real-world toxic language. This paper
introduces novel attention regularization methodologies to improve the
generalization capabilities of PLMs for counter narratives generation.
Overfitting to training-specific terms is then discouraged, resulting in more
diverse and richer narratives. We experiment with two attention-based
regularization techniques on a benchmark English dataset. Regularized models
produce better counter narratives than state-of-the-art approaches in most
cases, both in terms of automatic metrics and human evaluation, especially when
hateful targets are not present in the training data. This work paves the way
for better and more flexible counter-speech generation models, a task for which
datasets are highly challenging to produce.

new bound is then examined for two sequential decoding algorithms, an

results as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per information bit ($\gamma_b$) is
greater than or equal to 8 dB. However, the theoretical bound may become
markedly higher than the simulated average complexity when $\gamma_b$ is small.
For the MLSDA, the theoretical upper bound is quite close to the simulation
results for both high SNR ($\gamma_b\geq 6$ dB) and low SNR ($\gamma_b\leq 2$

counterfactual regression (CFR) maps individuals' covariates to a latent space
and predicts their counterfactual outcomes. However, the selection bias between
control and treatment groups often imbalances the two groups' latent
distributions and negatively impacts this method's performance. In this study,
we revisit counterfactual regression through the lens of information bottleneck
and propose a novel learning paradigm called Gromov-Wasserstein information
bottleneck (GWIB). In this paradigm, we learn CFR by maximizing the mutual
information between covariates' latent representations and outcomes while
penalizing the kernelized mutual information between the latent representations
and the covariates. We demonstrate that the upper bound of the penalty term can
be implemented as a new regularizer consisting of $i)$ the fused
Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the latent representations of different
groups and $ii)$ the gap between the transport cost generated by the model and
the cross-group Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the latent representations
and the covariates. GWIB effectively learns the CFR model through alternating
optimization, suppressing selection bias while avoiding trivial latent
distributions. Experiments on ITE estimation tasks show that GWIB consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art CFR methods. To promote the research community, we

Doppler velocity measurements from a Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW)
lidar without data association. FMCW lidar is a recently emerging technology
that enables per-return relative radial velocity measurements via the Doppler
effect. Since the Doppler measurement model is linear with respect to the
6-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) vehicle velocity, we can formulate a linear
continuous-time estimation problem for the velocity and numerically integrate
for the 6-DOF pose estimate afterward. The caveat is that angular velocity is
not observable with a single FMCW lidar. We address this limitation by also
incorporating the angular velocity measurements from a gyroscope. This results
in an extremely efficient odometry method that processes lidar frames at an
average wall-clock time of 5.64ms on a single thread, well below the 10Hz
operating rate of the lidar we tested. We show experimental results on
real-world driving sequences and compare against state-of-the-art Iterative
Closest Point (ICP)-based odometry methods, presenting a compelling trade-off
between accuracy and computation. We also present an algebraic observability
study, where we demonstrate in theory that the Doppler measurements from

driving laser. In this work, we perform an experimental and theoretical study
of the causes that generate spectral changes in the HHG radiation. We measured
the driving laser spectral shift after high harmonic generation in long medium
using a correction factor to take into account the multiple possible HHG
initiation distances along the laser path. We separate out the contribution of
laser spectral shift from the resultant high harmonic spectral shift in order
to elucidate the microscopic effect of spectral shift in HHG. Therefore, in
some cases we are able to identify the dominant electron trajectory from the
experimental data. Our investigations lead to valuable conclusions about atomic
dipole phase contribution to a high harmonic spectral shift. We demonstrate
that the significant contribution of a long electron path leads to a high
harmonic shift, which differs from that expected from the driving laser.
Moreover, we assess the origin of the high-order harmonics spectral broadening
and provide an explanation for the narrowest high harmonic spectral width in
our experiment.

time-dependent density functional theory to control the valley degree of
freedom relating to the dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect (DFKE) in a monolayer of
transition metal dichalcogenide. By mimicking the attosecond transient
absorption spectroscopy, we performed numerical pump-probe experiments to
observe DFKE around the $K$ or $K'$ valley in WSe$_2$ monolayer with a
linearly-polarized pump field and a circularly-polarized probe pulse. We found
that the circularly-polarized probe pulse with a given helicity can selectively
observe the transient conductivity modulated by DFKE in each valley. The
transient conductivity and excitation probability around each valley oscillate
with the pump field frequency $\Omega$. The phases of the $\Omega$ oscillation
for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys are opposite to each other. Furthermore, the
pump-driven DFKE alters the absorption rate of WSe$_2$ monolayer and yields the
valley-dependent $\Omega$ oscillation of the electron excitation induced by the
pump plus probe field. With a simplified two-band model, we identified the
$\Omega$ oscillation of the off-diagonal conductivity caused by the band
asymmetry around the valleys as the physical mechanism responsible for the
valley-selective DFKE.

math/0401054,Kevin Zumbrun,Kevin Zumbrun,"Planar stability critera for viscous shock waves of systems with real
  viscosity","Course notes for CIME summer school, July 2003, Cetraro, Italy",,,,math.AP,,"  We present a streamlined account of recent developments in the stability
theory for planar viscous shock waves, with an emphasis on applications to
physical models with ``real,'' or partial viscosity. The main result is the
establishment of necessary, or ``weak'', and sufficient, or ``strong'',
conditions for nonlinear stability analogous to those established by Majda
[Ma.1--3] in the inviscid case but (generically) separated by a codimension-one
set in parameter space rather than an open set as in the inviscid case. The
importance of codimension one is that transition between nonlinear stability
and instability is thereby determined, lying on the boundary set between the
open regions of strong stability and strong instability (the latter defined as
failure of weak stability). Strong stability holds always for small-amplitude
shocks of classical ``Lax'' type [PZ.1--2, FreS]; for large-amplitude shocks,
however, strong instability may occur [ZS, Z.3].

  Phthalocyanine/C60 Donor-Acceptor Charge Transfer Pairs",,,,,cond-mat.mtrl-sci,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We have calculated several low-lying Charge Transfer (CT) excited-state
energies for four non-covalently bound dyads composed of a sulfonated-ZnPc
coupled to C60. Our results show that the di- and tri-sulfonated systems yield
a CT state as the lowest-energy excited state in the system. In contrast, an
energy re-ordering for the tetra-sulfonated ZnPc system leads to local
excitations lying lower in energy than the CT state, displaying a possible
deactivation pathway obstructing charge separation. Since several different
donor-acceptor relative orientations may co-exist at an organic heterojunction,
we compare the energetics of a few low-lying CT states for the end-on geometry
of a di-sulfonated system to its co-facial orientation counterpart. The
calculated CT excitation energies are larger for the end-on orientation in
comparison to the co-facial structure by ~1.5 eV, which results principally
from a substantial decrease in exciton binding energy in going from the
co-facial to the end-on orientation. Furthermore, changes in relative
donor-acceptor orientation have a larger impact on the CT energies than changes
in donor-acceptor distance. TDDFT calculations on the various sulfonated ZnPc
donor molecules show a significant splitting of the Q-band for only one of the
four donor systems. Our present calculations, in line with previous
experimental studies, show that the systematic variation of chemical functional
groups is a promising avenue for the substituent-level tuning of various
physical properties of organic semiconductors.

has important consequences for the loading of particles into a target Floquet

this work, we analyse how such loading sequences can be optimized in view of
probing the topology of Floquet bands through transport measurements. In
particular, we demonstrate the robustness of center-of-mass responses, as
compared to current responses, which present important irregularities due to an
interplay between the micro-motion of the drive and inter-band interference
effects. The results presented in this work illustrate how probing the
center-of-mass displacement of atomic clouds offers a reliable method to detect
the topology of Floquet bands, after realistic loading sequences.

is enhanced by introducing a nano cavity antenna formed by a nearby metallic

a non-resonant nano slit, the slit should be opened at a position with maximal

The transmission spectrum of the nano slit can also be tuned by adjusting the

quantum gravity and also in quantum foundations once considering laboratories
as physical systems. Both fields thereby face the question of how to describe
physics relative to quantum reference systems and how the descriptions relative
to different such choices are related. Here, we exploit a fruitful interplay of
ideas from both fields to begin developing a unifying approach to
transformations among quantum reference systems that ultimately aims at
encompassing both quantum and gravitational physics. In particular, using a
gravity inspired symmetry principle, which enforces physical observables to be
relational and leads to an inherent redundancy in the description, we develop a
perspective-neutral structure, which contains all frame perspectives at once
and via which they are changed. We show that taking the perspective of a
specific frame amounts to a fixing of the symmetry related redundancies in both
the classical and quantum theory and that changing perspective corresponds to a
symmetry transformation. We implement this using the language of constrained
systems, which naturally encodes symmetries. Within a simple one-dimensional
model, we recover some of the quantum frame transformations of
arXiv:1712.07207, embedding them in a perspective-neutral framework. Using
them, we illustrate how entanglement and classicality of an observed system
depend on the quantum frame perspective. Our operational language also inspires
a new interpretation of Dirac and reduced quantized theories within our model
as perspective-neutral and perspectival quantum theories, respectively, and
reveals the explicit link between them. In this light, we suggest a new take on
the relation between a `quantum general covariance' and the diffeomorphism

computer science. The task is to find a matching between two sides of agents
that have preferences over who they want to be matched with. A matching is
stable if no pair of agents prefer each other over their current matches. The
deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale and Shapley solves this problem in
polynomial time. Further, it is a mechanism: the proposing side in the
algorithm is always incentivised to report their preferences truthfully. The
deferred acceptance algorithm has a natural interpretation as a distributed
algorithm (and thus a distributed mechanism). However, the algorithm is slow in
the worst case and it is known that the stable matching problem cannot be
solved efficiently in the distributed setting. In this work we study a natural
special case of the stable matching problem where all agents on one side share
common preferences. We show that in this case the deferred acceptance algorithm

Direct accretion onto this fast rotating neutron star is impeded by the

constant. For the first time, we obtain a global phase diagram where the
non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point of asymptotic safety is connected via
smooth trajectories to a classical infrared fixed point. The theory is
therefore ultraviolet complete and deforms smoothly into classical gravity as
the infrared limit is approached.

among related tasks to extract common features and yield performance gains.
However, most previous works treat labels of each task as independent and
meaningless one-hot vectors, which cause a loss of potential information and
makes it difficult for these models to jointly learn three or more tasks. In
this paper, we propose Multi-Task Label Embedding to convert labels in text
classification into semantic vectors, thereby turning the original tasks into
vector matching tasks. We implement unsupervised, supervised and
semi-supervised models of Multi-Task Label Embedding, all utilizing semantic
correlations among tasks and making it particularly convenient to scale and
transfer as more tasks are involved. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets for text classification show that our models can effectively improve
performances of related tasks with semantic representations of labels and
additional information from each other.

full properties of cascades to achieve satisfactory prediction performances. In
this paper, we propose an explicit Time embedding based Cascade Attention
Network (TCAN) as a novel popularity prediction architecture for large-scale
information networks. TCAN integrates temporal attributes (i.e., periodicity,
linearity, and non-linear scaling) into node features via a general time

(CGAT) and a cascade sequence attention encoder (CSAT) to fully learn the
representation of cascade graphs and cascade sequences. We use two real-world

validate our methods. Experimental results show that TCAN obtains mean

J., vol.208, p.1 (2024)",,,astro-ph.SR,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,"  Contact binaries are close binary systems in which both components fill their
inner Roche lobes so that the stars are in direct contact and in potential mass
and energy exchange. The most common such systems of low-mass are the so-called
W UMa-type. In the last few years, there is a growing interest of the
astronomical community in stellar mergers, primarily due to the detection of
gravitational waves (mergers of black holes and neutron stars), but also
because of an alternative model for type Ia supernovae (merger of two white
dwarfs), which are again particularly important in cosmology where they played
an important role in the discovery of dark energy and the accelerated expansion
of the Universe. In that sense, contact systems of W UMa-type with extremely
low mass ratio are especially interesting because there are indications that in
their case, too, stars can merge and possible form fast-rotating stars such as
FC Com stars and the blue-stragglers, and (luminous) red novae such as V1309
Sco. Namely, previous theoretical research has shown that in the cases when the
orbital angular momentum of the system is only about three times larger than
the rotational angular momentum of the primary, a tidal Darwin's instability
occurs, the components can no longer remain in synchronous rotation, orbit
continue to shrink fast and they finally merge into a single star. The above
stability condition for contact systems can be linked to some critical mass
ratio below which we expect a system to be unstable. We give an overview of
this condition and show how it can be used to identify potential mergers.
Finally, we discuss a number of known extreme mass ratio binaries from the
literature and prospect for future research on this topic.

recorded using de Broglie spectrographs. The electron temperature and
density(Te = 80 eV and ne = 1x1020 cm-3), as well as the hot electron beam
fraction (f = 0.2 and energy centered at 10 keV) in the Al plasma, were

Finally, these transitions follows the elliptic polarization of Stokes V

fragmentation at 670 MeV per nucleon. The fragmentation products were injected
as highly charged ions into the GSI storage ring, giving access to masses and
half-lives. While the excitation energy of the first isomer of 212Bi was
confirmed, the second isomer was observed at 1478(30) keV, in contrast to the
previously accepted value of >1910 keV. It was also found to have an extended
Lorentz-corrected in-ring halflife >30 min, compared to 7.0(3) min for the

being due a substantial, though previously unrecognised, internal decay branch

investigate the relationship between AM-regularity and other constraint
qualifications from nonsmooth optimization like metric (sub-)regularity of the
underlying feasibility mapping. Our findings are applied to optimization
problems with geometric and, particularly, disjunctive constraints. This way,
it is shown that AM-regularity recovers recently introduced

highly nonlinear equations of motion. We find that the dipole and breathing
oscillations of the condensate along the direction of gauge field are coupled
by this field. For a quasi-onedimensional condensate, this coupling makes the
collective motion quasiperiodic. While for a quasitwo-dimensional condensate,
the gauge field can also induce a Hall effect, manifested as an additional
coupling between dipole and breathing oscillations in perpendicular direction.
When the densitydependent gauge field is strong, the interplay between these
oscillations can cause the collective dynamics of the condensate to become
chaotic. Our findings reveal an important effect of dynamical gauge field on

  Multiple Feedback Types","Published at AAAI 2023; 10 pages, 5 figures plus appendices",,,,cs.LG cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  When inferring reward functions from human behavior (be it demonstrations,
comparisons, physical corrections, or e-stops), it has proven useful to model
the human as making noisy-rational choices, with a ""rationality coefficient""
capturing how much noise or entropy we expect to see in the human behavior.
Prior work typically sets the rationality level to a constant value, regardless
of the type, or quality, of human feedback. However, in many settings, giving
one type of feedback (e.g. a demonstration) may be much more difficult than a
different type of feedback (e.g. answering a comparison query). Thus, we expect
to see more or less noise depending on the type of human feedback. In this
work, we advocate that grounding the rationality coefficient in real data for
each feedback type, rather than assuming a default value, has a significant
positive effect on reward learning. We test this in both simulated experiments
and in a user study with real human feedback. We find that overestimating human
rationality can have dire effects on reward learning accuracy and regret. We
also find that fitting the rationality coefficient to human data enables better
reward learning, even when the human deviates significantly from the
noisy-rational choice model due to systematic biases. Further, we find that the
rationality level affects the informativeness of each feedback type:
surprisingly, demonstrations are not always the most informative -- when the
human acts very suboptimally, comparisons actually become more informative,
even when the rationality level is the same for both. Ultimately, our results
emphasize the importance and advantage of paying attention to the assumed
human-rationality level, especially when agents actively learn from multiple
types of human feedback.

diffuse radiation from the intercluster medium (ICM) at radio, EUV and hard
x-ray (HXR) ranges. The radio radiation is due to synchrotron by relativistic
electrons, and the inverse Compton (IC) scattering by the cosmic microwave
background radiation of the same electrons is the most natural source for the
HXR and perhaps the EUV emissions. However, simple estimates give a weaker
magnetic field than that suggested by Faraday rotation measurements.
Consequently, non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) and TB have also been suggested
as sources of these emissions. We show that NTB cannot be the source of the
HXRs and that the difficulty with the low magnetic field in the IC model is
alleviated if we take into account the effects of observational bias,
nonisotropic pitch angle distribution and spectral breaks. We derive a spectrum
for the radiating electrons and discuss acceleration scenarios. We show that
continuous and in situ acceleration in the ICM of the background thermal
electrons requires unreasonably high energy input and acceleration of injected
relativistic electrons gives rise to a much flatter spectrum than desired,
unless a large fraction of electrons escape the ICM, in which case one obtains
EUV and HXR emissions extending well beyond the boundaries of the cluster. A
continuous emission by a cooling spectrum resulting from interaction with ICM
of electrons accelerated elsewhere also suffers from similar shortcomings. The
most likely scenario appears to be an episodic injection-acceleration model,
whereby one obtains a time dependent spectrum that for certain phases of its
evolution satisfies all the requirements.

informative exploration. The policy by solving is then used for generating more
experience that helps in updating the posterior over the model parameters. We

downstream applications. Further, as a use-case for the corpus, we introduce
the task of bail prediction. We experiment with a battery of models and propose
a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based model for the same. MTL models use

constructing models solely relying on unlabeled data. These models operate on
the presumption that no labeled anomalous examples are available, which
prevents them from utilizing prior knowledge of anomalies that are typically
present in small numbers in many real-world applications. Furthermore, these
models prioritize learning feature embeddings rather than optimizing anomaly
scores directly, which could lead to suboptimal anomaly scoring and inefficient
use of data during the learning process. In this paper, we introduce FATE, a
deep few-shot learning-based framework that leverages limited anomaly examples
and learns anomaly scores explicitly in an end-to-end method using deviation
learning. In this approach, the anomaly scores of normal examples are adjusted
to closely resemble reference scores obtained from a prior distribution.
Conversely, anomaly samples are forced to have anomalous scores that
considerably deviate from the reference score in the upper tail of the prior.
Additionally, our model is optimized to learn the distinct behavior of
anomalies by utilizing a multi-head self-attention layer and multiple instance
learning approaches. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed approach attains a new level of state-of-the-art
performance.

larger LLMs trained on more data. We found that training on short sequences
performed better than training on longer sequences.Pretraining on music may

without introducing any $B-L$ violation by two units. An additional scalar
doublet with appropriate $B-L$ charge can allow heavy fermion coupling with the
SM leptons so that out of equilibrium decay of the former can lead to
generation of lepton asymmetry. Due to the $B-L$ gauge interactions of the
decaying fermion, the criteria of successful Dirac leptogenesis can also
constrain the gauge sector couplings so as to keep the corresponding washout
processes under control. The same $B-L$ gauge sector parameter space can also
be constrained from dark matter requirements if the latter is assumed to be a
SM singlet particle with non-zero $B-L$ charge. The same $B-L$ gauge
interactions also lead to additional thermalised relativistic degrees of

constrained by Planck 2018 data. While there exists parameter space from the

spatial dependencies across axial slices. We demonstrate that leveraging
intra-slice dependencies substantially increases the sensitivity to detect
pulmonary nodules without inflating the false positive rate. On the publicly
available LIDC/IDRI dataset consisting of 1,018 annotated CT scans, ReCTnet
reaches a detection sensitivity of 90.5% with an average of 4.5 false positives

network functionality. However, the presence of middleboxes drastically
complicates the task of network verification. Previous work showed that the
problem is undecidable in general and EXPSPACE-complete when abstracting away
the order of packet arrival.
  We describe a new algorithm for conservatively checking isolation properties
of stateful networks. The asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is polynomial
in the size of the network, albeit being exponential in the maximal number of
queries of the local state that a middlebox can do, which is often small.
  Our algorithm is sound, i.e., it can never miss a violation of safety but may
fail to verify some properties. The algorithm performs on-the fly abstract
interpretation by (1) abstracting away the order of packet processing and the
number of times each packet arrives, (2) abstracting away correlations between
states of different middleboxes and channel contents, and (3) representing
middlebox states by their effect on each packet separately, rather than taking
into account the entire state space. We show that the abstractions do not lose
precision when middleboxes may reset in any state. This is encouraging since
many real middleboxes reset, e.g., after some session timeout is reached or due
to hardware failure.

and $O(n)$ time on paths, where $n$ is the number of vertices. Our algorithms
improve the previous best runtime of $O(n \log^5 n)$ on trees

To do so, we move beyond the simulation of individual events by directly
computing the number of firings for each vertex. The computation is accelerated
using splittable binary search trees. In addition, we give algorithms in $O(n)$

been one of the most important reasons that prevent the extensive applications
of GRBs in cosmology. Many efforts have been made to seek tight luminosity
relations. With the latest sample of 116 GRBs with measured redshift and
spectral parameters, we investigate 6 two-dimensional (2D) correlations and 14
derived three-dimensional (3D) correlations of GRBs to explore the possibility
of decreasing the intrinsic scatters of the luminosity relations of GRBs. We
find the 3D correlation of $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ to be
evidently tighter (at the $2 \sigma$ confidence level) than its corresponding
2D correlations, i.e., the $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$L$ and
$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ correlations. In addition, the coefficients before
the logarithms of $E_{\mathrm{peak}}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$ in the
$E_{\mathrm{peak}}$--$\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}$--$L$ correlation are almost exact
opposites of each other. Inputting this situation as a prior reduces the
relation to $L \propto (E_{\mathrm{peak}}^{'} / \tau_{\mathrm{RT}}^{'})^{0.842
\pm 0.064}$, where $E_{\mathrm{peak}}^{'}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{RT}}^{'}$ denote
the peak energy and minimum rise time in the GRB rest frame. We discuss how our
findings can be interpreted/understood in the framework of the definition of
the luminosity (energy released in units of time). Our argument about the
connection between the luminosity relations of GRBs and the definition of the
luminosity provides a clear direction for exploring tighter luminosity

However, under the current market structure, investments for these technologies
only receive a regulated rate of return, providing little to no incentive for
efficient operation. Additionally, a regulated rate of return creates an
incentive for building more transmission lines rather than efficient
utilization of the existing system. Therefore, investments in flexible
transmission technologies remain rather limited. To facilitate the deployment

elements and the neutrino oscillation probability formula to second order
(third order in \nu_e related channels) in \epsilon. The formula allows us to
estimate size of the contribution of any particular NSI element
\epsilon_{\alpha beta} to the oscillation probability in arbitrary channels,
and gives a global bird-eye view of the neutrino oscillation phenomena with
NSI. Based on the second-order formula we discuss how all the conventional
lepton mixing as well as NSI parameters can be determined. Our results shows
that while \theta_{13}, \delta, and the NSI elements in \nu_e sector can in
principle be determined, complete measurement of the NSI parameters in the
\nu_\mu - \nu_\tau sector is not possible by the rate only analysis. The
discussion for parameter determination and the analysis based on the matter
perturbation theory indicate that the parameter degeneracy prevails with the
NSI parameters. In addition, a new solar-atmospheric variable exchange
degeneracy is found. Some general properties of neutrino oscillation with and

from a purely unitary model with long range exciton interactions to a
noise-aided stochastic resonance models. Here we propose a very simple
spin-boson model that captures all the features of the efficient part of energy
transfer. We show how this model describes a scenario where a donor-acceptor

that the excitation transfer between the two can be made arbitrarily high. This

selected using redshift dependent quantities. From an Eulerian view-point, this
effect is caused by the apparent movement of galaxies into or out of the
sample. From a Lagrangian view-point, we find that projecting the
redshift-space overdensity field over a finite radial distance does not remove
all the anisotropic distortions. We investigate this effect, showing that it
strongly boosts the amplitude of clustering for narrow samples and can also
reduce the significance of baryonic features in the correlation function. We
argue that the effect can be mitigated by binning in apparent galaxy
pair-centre rather than galaxy position, and applying an upper limit to the
radial galaxy separation. We demonstrate this approach, contrasting against
standard top-hat binning in galaxy distance, using sub-samples taken from the
Hubble Volume simulations. Using a simple model for the radial distribution
expected for galaxies from a survey such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we
show that this binning scheme will simplify analyses that will measure baryon
acoustic oscillations within such galaxy samples. Comparing results from
different binning schemes has the potential to provide measurements of the
amplitude of the redshift-space distortions. Our analysis is relevant for other
photometric redshift surveys, including those made by the Panoramic Survey

implies that every so implementable JL matrix must be sign-consistent (i.e.,

  We construct sparse JL matrices that are sign-consistent, and prove that our
construction is essentially optimal. Our work answers a mathematical question

research has found that SSL improves the adversarial robustness over supervised
learning since lacking labels makes it more challenging for adversaries to
manipulate model predictions. However, the extent to which this robustness
superiority generalizes to other types of attacks remains an open question.
  We explore this question in the context of backdoor attacks. Specifically, we
design and evaluate CTRL, an embarrassingly simple yet highly effective
self-supervised backdoor attack. By only polluting a tiny fraction of training
data (<= 1%) with indistinguishable poisoning samples, CTRL causes any
trigger-embedded input to be misclassified to the adversary's designated class
with a high probability (>= 99%) at inference time. Our findings suggest that
SSL and supervised learning are comparably vulnerable to backdoor attacks. More
importantly, through the lens of CTRL, we study the inherent vulnerability of
SSL to backdoor attacks. With both empirical and analytical evidence, we reveal
that the representation invariance property of SSL, which benefits adversarial
robustness, may also be the very reason making \ssl highly susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Our findings also imply that the existing defenses against
supervised backdoor attacks are not easily retrofitted to the unique
vulnerability of SSL.

performance but is known to suffer vulnerability to input perturbations. As
real input noise is difficult to predict during training, robustness is a big
issue for system deployment. In this paper, we improve the robustness of NMT
models by reducing the effect of noisy words through a Context-Enhanced
Reconstruction (CER) approach. CER trains the model to resist noise in two
steps: (1) perturbation step that breaks the naturalness of input sequence with
made-up words; (2) reconstruction step that defends the noise propagation by
generating better and more robust contextual representation. Experimental
results on Chinese-English (ZH-EN) and French-English (FR-EN) translation tasks
demonstrate robustness improvement on both news and social media text. Further
fine-tuning experiments on social media text show our approach can converge at
a higher position and provide a better adaptation.

for first-order real arithmetic by linear and quadratic virtual substitution

QE algorithms are highly complicated and often combine multiple methods for
performance. VS is a practically successful method for QE that targets formulas
with low-degree polynomials. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formalize VS for quadratic real arithmetic including inequalities. The proofs
necessitate various contributions to the existing multivariate polynomial
libraries in Isabelle/HOL. Our framework is modularized and easily expandable
(to facilitate integrating future optimizations), and could serve as a basis
for developing practical general-purpose QE algorithms. Further, as our
formalization is designed with practicality in mind, we export our development
to SML and test the resulting code on 378 benchmarks from the literature,
comparing to Redlog, Z3, Wolfram Engine, and SMT-RAT. This identified
inconsistencies in some tools, underscoring the significance of a verified

reasonable assumption as each user will like/dislike a trait to certain extent.

measurement is marginal, and we find new critical states whose entanglement
entropy exhibits a logarithmic behavior with a continuous effective central

this method the Steepness Ratio Technique (SRT). The SRT uses the convolution
between the real RASS point-spread function and the cluster emission profile
assumed to be a beta-model with the beta parameter fixed to the value of 2/3.
From the convolved source emission profile the SRT extracts total flux and
extension (i.e., core radius) for each cluster. Using the Steepness Ratio (SR)
and a control sample of RASS pointlike sources we are able to assign to each
RASS source a model-independent probability of extension. Potential biases
arising from the hypotheses of a beta-model emission profile and from a fixed
beta value are quantified. Tests with control samples of optically identified
sources extracted from both the ROSAT survey database and from the ROSAT-PSPC
pointed observations archive are performed to check the SRT output. We find
that the source properties derived using the SRT on RASS data are consistent
with those determined from ROSAT-PSPC pointed observations.

its quantum ground state or to prepare nonclassical states exhibiting a

entangling interactions between qubits stored in distant DWs, which could
facilitate the implementation of a universal set of quantum gates. Our proposal
relies only on the intrinsic degrees of freedom of the ferromagnet, and can be
naturally extended to explore the quantum dynamics of DWs in ferrimagnets and
antiferromagnets, as well as quantum vortices or skyrmions confined in

enhancement of the power spectrum $\Delta_\zeta$ of the curvature fluctuation
$\zeta$ at wavelengths much shorter than those of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropies. This is typically achieved in models where $\zeta$
evolves without interacting significantly with additional (isocurvature) scalar
degrees of freedom. However, quantum gravity inspired models are characterized
by moduli spaces with highly curved geometries and a large number of scalar
fields that could vigorously interact with $\zeta$ (as in the cosmological
collider picture). Here we show that isocurvature fluctuations can mix with
$\zeta$ inducing large enhancements of its amplitude. This occurs whenever the
inflationary trajectory experiences rapid turns in the field space of the model
leading to amplifications that are exponentially sensitive to the total angle
swept by the turn, which induce characteristic observable signatures on
$\Delta_\zeta$. We derive accurate analytical predictions and show that the
large enhancements required for PBHs demand non-canonical kinetic terms in the

and their effect on performance is today unclear. This study presents
experimental evidence and preliminary observations on the impact that
increasing velocity has on the tractive performance of planetary rovers.
Single-wheel driving tests were conducted using two different metallic,
grousered wheels-one rigid and one flexible-over two different soils, olivine
sand and CaCO3-based silty soil. Experiments were conducted at speeds between
0.01-1 m/s throughout an ample range of slip ratios (5-90%). Three performance
metrics were evaluated: drawbar pull coefficient, wheel sinkage, and tractive
efficiency. Results showed similar data trends among all the cases
investigated. Drawbar pull and tractive efficiency considerably decreased for
speeds beyond 0.2 m/s. Wheel sinkage, unlike what published evidence suggested,
increased with increasing velocities. The flexible wheel performed the best at
1m/s, exhibiting 2 times higher drawbar pull and efficiency with 18% lower
sinkage under low slip conditions. Although similar data trends were obtained,
a different wheel-soil interactive behavior was observed when driving over the
different soils. Overall, despite the performance reduction experienced at
higher velocities, a speed in the range of 0.2-0.3 m/s would enable 5-10 times
faster traverses, compared to current rovers driving capability, while only
diminishing drawbar pull and efficiency by 7%. The measurements collected and
the analysis presented here lay the groundwork for initial stages in the

transient elements within each orbit is much less understood.
  Recent work of Pham considered the orbits corresponding to a family of
necklaces $P^\ell$ that are concatenations of $\ell$ copies of a fixed
primitive necklace $P$. She proved striking limiting behavior as $\ell$ goes to
infinity: the level statistic for the orbit, counting how many steps it takes a
partition to reach the recurrent cycle, has a limiting distribution, whose
generating function $H_p(x)$ is rational. Pham also conjectured that $H_P(x),

reading it backwards and swapping $B$ for $W$.

alternative possibility: the Universe contains a substantial independent
population of super-massive black holes, and QSO's are a phenomenon that occurs

$F_r(t)$ of the first detection time of a 'state of interest' in a generic
quantum system subjected to random projective measurements. In our 'quantum
resetting' protocol, resetting of a state is not implemented by an additional
classical stochastic move, but rather by the random projective measurement. We
then apply this general framework to Poissoinian measurement protocol with a
constant rate $r$ and demonstrate that exact results for $F_r(t)$ can be
obtained for a generic two level system. Interestingly, the result depends
crucially on the detection schemes involved and we have studied two
complementary schemes, where the state of interest either coincides or differs
from the initial state. We show that $F_r(t)$ at short times vanishes
universally as $F_r(t)\sim t^2$ as $t\to 0$ in the first scheme, while it
approaches a constant as $t\to 0$ in the second scheme. The mean first
detection time, as a function of the measurement rate $r$, also shows rather
different behaviors in the two schemes. In the former, the mean detection time
is a nonmonotonic function of $r$ with a single minimum at an optimal value
$r^*$, while in the later, it is a monotonically decreasing function of $r$,
signalling the absence of a finite optimal value. These general predictions for
arbitrary two level systems are then verified via explicit computation in the
Jaynes-Cummings model of light-matter interaction. We also generalise our
results to non-Poissonian measurement protocols with a renewal structure where
the intervals between successive independent measurements are distributed via a
general distribution $p(\tau)$ and show that the short time behavior of
$F_r(t)\sim p(0)\, t^2$ is universal as long as $p(0)\ne 0$. This universal
$t^2$ law emerges from purely quantum dynamics that dominates at early times.

of the size of a ball that contains a symplectic image of the ellipsoid
$E(1,a)$. (Here $a \ge 1$ is the ratio of the area of the large axis to that of
the smaller axis.) The structure of the graph of $c(a)$ is surprisingly rich.
The volume constraint implies that $c(a)$ is always greater than or equal to
the square root of $a$, and it is not hard to see that this is equality for
large $a$. However, for $a$ less than the fourth power $\tau^4$ of the golden
ratio, $c(a)$ is piecewise linear, with graph that alternately lies on a line
through the origin and is horizontal. We prove this by showing that there are
exceptional curves in blow ups of the complex projective plane whose homology
classes are given by the continued fraction expansions of ratios of Fibonacci
numbers. On the interval $[\tau^4,7]$ we find $c(a)=(a+1)/3$. For $a \ge 7$,
the function $c(a)$ coincides with the square root except on a finite number of
intervals where it is again piecewise linear.
  The embedding constraints coming from embedded contact homology give rise to
another capacity function $c_{ECH}$ which may be computed by counting lattice
points in appropriate right angled triangles. According to Hutchings and
Taubes, the functorial properties of embedded contact homology imply that
$c_{ECH}(a) \le c(a)$ for all $a$. We show here that $c_{ECH}(a) \ge c(a)$ for
all $a$.

timeframe (a few years to a few decades). One of these cases, GJ 4326, is
however identified as probably being substantially older than has been implied
from its apparent moving group membership, based on astrometric and isochronal
arguments. With further astrometric monitoring, these targets will provide a

from data streams with a massive amount of data. Many algorithms have been
proposed to handle these difficulties, among them, the Very Fast Decision Tree
(VFDT) algorithm. Although the VFDT has been widely used in data stream mining,
in the last years, several authors have suggested modifications to increase its
performance, putting aside memory concerns by proposing memory-costly
solutions. Besides, most data stream mining solutions have been centred around
ensembles, which combine the memory costs of their weak learners, usually
VFDTs. To reduce the memory cost, keeping the predictive performance, this
study proposes the Strict VFDT (SVFDT), a novel algorithm based on the VFDT.
The SVFDT algorithm minimises unnecessary tree growth, substantially reducing
memory usage and keeping competitive predictive performance. Moreover, since it
creates much more shallow trees than VFDT, SVFDT can achieve a shorter
processing time. Experiments were carried out comparing the SVFDT with the VFDT
in 11 benchmark data stream datasets. This comparison assessed the trade-off
between accuracy, memory, and processing time. Statistical analysis showed that
the proposed algorithm obtained similar predictive performance and
significantly reduced processing time and memory use. Thus, SVFDT is a suitable
option for data stream mining with memory and time limitations, recommended as
a weak learner in ensemble-based solutions.

the seismic tensor when inverting signals whose wavelengths significantly
exceed the source depth. As a consequence, instability affects both source
depth and fault plane solution retrieval, and spurious large Compensated Linear

  International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)",,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In this paper, we propose a new coded computing technique called ""substitute
decoding"" for general iterative distributed computation tasks. In the first
part of the paper, we use PageRank as a simple example to show that substitute
decoding can make the computation of power iterations solving PageRank on
sparse matrices robust to erasures in distributed systems. For these sparse
matrices, codes with dense generator matrices can significantly increase
storage costs and codes with low-density generator matrices (LDGM) are
preferred. Surprisingly, we show through both theoretical analysis and
simulations that when substitute decoding is used, coded iterative computing
with extremely low-density codes (2 or 3 non-zeros in each row of the generator
matrix) can achieve almost the same convergence rate as noiseless techniques,
despite the poor error-correction ability of LDGM codes. In the second part of
the paper, we discuss applications of substitute decoding beyond solving linear
systems and PageRank. These applications include (1) computing eigenvectors,
(2) computing the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), and (3)
gradient descent. These examples show that the substitute decoding algorithm is
useful in a wide range of applications.

electrical properties and a wide range of potential practical applications. In
addition, graphene hybrid structures combined with other 2D materials, metal
microstructures, silicon photonic crystal cavities, and waveguides have more
extensive applications in van der Waals heterostructures, hybrid graphene
plasmonics, hybrid optoelectronic devices, and optical modulators. Based on
well-developed transfer methods, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) is currently used in most of the graphene hybrid applications. Although
mechanical exfoliation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite provides the
highest-quality graphene, the transfer of the desired microcleaving graphene
(MG) to the structure at a specific position is a critical challenge, that
limits the combination of MG with other structures. Herein, we report a new
technique for the selective transfer of MG patterns and devices onto chosen
targets using a bilayer-polymer structure and femtosecond laser
microfabrication. This selective transfer technique, which exactly transfers
the patterned graphene onto a chosen target, leaving the other flakes on the
original substrate, provides an efficient route for the fabrication of MG-based
microdevices. This method will facilitate the preparation of van der Waals
heterostructures and enable the optimization of the performance of graphene
hybrid devices.

  magnetic field and unification with low-mass X-ray binaries","MNRAS, in press",,10.1093/mnras/stz3447,,astro-ph.HE,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The high-mass accreting binary Cyg X-3 is distinctly different from low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in having powerful radio and $\gamma$-ray emitting jets
in its soft spectral state. However, the transition from the hard state to the
soft one is first associated with quenching of the hard-state radio emission,
as in LMXBs. The powerful soft-state jets in Cyg X-3 form, on average, $\sim$50
d later. We interpret the initial jet quenching as due to the hard-state
vertical magnetic field quickly diffusing away in the thin disc extending to
the innermost stable circular orbit in the soft state, or, if that field is
produced in situ, also cessation of its generation. The subsequent formation of
the powerful jets occurs due to advection of the magnetic field from the donor.
We find this happens only above certain threshold accretion rate associated
with appearance of magnetically driven outflows. The $\sim$50 d lag is of the
order of the viscous timescale in the outer disc, while the field advection is
much faster. This process does not happen in LMXBs due to the magnetic fluxes
available from their donors being lower than that for the wind accretion from
the Wolf-Rayet donor of Cyg X-3. In our model, the vertical magnetic field in
the hard state, required to form the jets both in Cyg X-3 and LMXBs, is formed
in situ rather than advected from the donor. Our results provide a unified
scenario of the soft and hard states in both Cyg X-3 and LMXBs.

neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. Two additional parameters include an
average neutrino escape energy and a neutrino trapping density. The
parameterized simulations reproduce the consequences of the delicate neutrino
thermalization/diffusion process during the collapse phase and provide a by far
more realistic alternative to the adiabatic approximation, which has often been
used in the investigation of the emission of gravitational waves, of
multi-dimensional general relativistic effects, of the evolution of magnetic
fields, or even of the nucleosynthesis in simulations of core collapse and
bounce. For supernova codes that are specifically designed for the postbounce
phase, the parameterization builds a convenient bridge between the point where
the applicability of a stellar evolution code ends and the point where the

form factors for the neutral hyperons and charged strange mesons are

that the $\Lambda^*$ peak is clearly observed for the photo- and

clear peak signals survive only for the electro-production, when we ignore the

dependences in the $K^*$ electromagnetic and $K^*\to\gamma K$ transition form
factors. We suggest a photon-polarization asymmetry $\Sigma$ to extract
information of the $K^*N\Lambda^*$ interaction. It turns out that $\Sigma$ near
the $\Lambda^*$ peak region becomes negative with a finite $K^*N\Lambda^*$
interaction while positive without it for $Q^2 = 0$, due to the different
naturalities of $K$ and $K^*$ exchanges. For $Q^2\ne 0$, we observe more
obvious signals in the peak region due to the additional contribution of the
longitudinal virtual photon for $\Lambda^*$.

While deep-learning-based approaches have demonstrated promising reconstruction
precision, these approaches have mostly focused on voxel-wise segmentation
followed by surface reconstruction and post-processing techniques. However,
such approaches suffer from a number of limitations including disconnected
regions or incorrect surface topology due to erroneous segmentation and
stair-case artifacts due to limited segmentation resolution. We propose a novel
deep-learning-based approach that directly predicts whole heart surface meshes
from volumetric CT and MR image data. Our approach leverages a graph
convolutional neural network to predict deformation on mesh vertices from a
pre-defined mesh template to reconstruct multiple anatomical structures in a 3D
image volume. Our method demonstrated promising performance of generating whole
heart reconstructions with as good or better accuracy than prior
deep-learning-based methods on both CT and MR data. Furthermore, by deforming a
template mesh, our method can generate whole heart geometries with better
anatomical consistency and produce high-resolution geometries from lower
resolution input image data. Our method was also able to produce temporally
consistent surface mesh predictions for heart motion from CT or MR cine
sequences, and therefore can potentially be applied for efficiently
constructing 4D whole heart dynamics. Our code and pre-trained networks are

of motion, Lagrange's equation, or Hamilton's principle for over 150 years. In
this work, contrary to classical continuum mechanics, a novel strategic
methodology is proposed for formulating general mechanical equations using the
principle of energy conservation. Firstly, based on Hamilton's principle,
Hamilton's equations, Lagrange's equation, and the elastodynamic equation of
motion are derived in arbitrarily anisotropic and multiphasic porous elastic
media, for the first time. Secondly, these equations are all formulated using
the principle of energy conservation for the related media. Both formulation
results using the two kinds of principles are compared and validated by each
other. The advantages of our methodology lie in that, the elastodynamic
equation of motion, Lagrange's equation, and Hamilton's equations in continuum
mechanics are directly formulated using a simple constraint of energy
conservation without introducing variational concepts. It is easy to understand
and has clear physical meanings. Our methodology unlocks the physics essences
of Hamilton's principle in continuum mechanics, which is a consequence of the
principle of energy conservation. Although the linear stress-strain
constitutive relation is considered, our methodology can still be used in a
nonlinear dynamical system. The methodology also paves an alternative way of
treating other complex continuous dynamical systems in a broad sense. In
addition, as an application, the continuity conditions at various medium
interfaces are also revisited and extended using our proposed approach, which
explains the law of reflections and refractions.

performing a joint weak lensing analysis of 2D shear and azimuthally averaged
magnification measurements. This combination allows for a complete analysis of
the field, effectively breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. In a Bayesian
framework, we simultaneously constrain the mass profile and morphology of each
individual cluster assuming an elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White halo
characterized by the mass, concentration, projected axis ratio, and position
angle of the projected major axis.. We find that spherical mass estimates of
the clusters from azimuthally averaged weak-lensing measurements in previous
work are in excellent agreement with our results from a full 2D analysis.
Combining all 20 clusters in our sample, we detect the elliptical shape of
weak-lensing halos at the $5\sigma$ significance level within a scale of
2Mpc$/h$. The median projected axis ratio is $0.67\pm 0.07$ at a virial mass of
$M_\mathrm{vir}=(15.2\pm 2.8) \times 10^{14} M_\odot$, which is in agreement
with theoretical predictions of the standard collisionless cold dark matter
model. We also study misalignment statistics of the brightest cluster galaxy,
X-ray, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and strong-lensing morphologies with
respect to the weak-lensing signal. Among the three baryonic tracers studied
here, we find that the X-ray morphology is best aligned with the weak-lensing
mass distribution, with a median misalignment angle of $21\pm 7$ degrees. We
also conduct a stacked quadrupole shear analysis assuming that the X-ray major
axis is aligned with that of the projected mass distribution. This yields a
consistent axis ratio of $0.67\pm 0.10$, suggesting again a tight alignment
between the intracluster gas and dark matter.

Aquila X-1 is similar to what has been observed in black hole X-ray binaries,
at least from the point of view of the behaviour in the hardness-intensity
diagrams (the hysteresis effect included), when the phenomenology of the jet is
taken into account. Although based on a very small number of observations, a
radio/X-ray correlation seems to exist for this system, with a slope of
alpha=0.40 +/- 0.07 (F_{radio} \propto F_{X}^{alpha}), which is different than
the slope of alpha=1.40 +/- 0.25 found for another atoll source, 4U 1728-34,
but interestingly enough is relatively close to the values obtained for several
black hole X-ray binaries. No significant correlation is found between the
radio and optical (R band) emissions. We also report a significant drop in the
radio flux from Aql X-1 above an X-ray flux of ~ 5 X 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2}
s^{-1}. This behaviour, also reported in the neutron star X-ray binary 4U

X-ray binaries in bright, soft X-ray states. It suggests that from this point
of view neutron star X-ray binaries can mimic the behaviour of black hole X-ray

thought to develop in large radio galaxies, while in other cases their jets may
experience intermittent activity or die prematurely and remain confined within
the host galaxy. By studying in a systematic way the presence and the
properties of any extended emission surrounding these compact sources we can
provide firmer constraints on their evolutionary history and on the timescales
of activity of the radio source. Remnant emission from previous outbursts is
supposed to have very low surface brightness and to be brighter at low
frequency. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution
provided by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) we have started a systematic search

decentralized training data. FL allows clients to update model parameters
locally for several epochs, then share them to a global model for aggregation.
This training paradigm with multi-local step updating before aggregation
exposes unique vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is
a popular and effective method to improve the robustness of networks against
adversaries. In this work, we formulate a general form of federated adversarial
learning (FAL) that is adapted from adversarial learning in the centralized
setting. On the client side of FL training, FAL has an inner loop to generate
adversarial samples for adversarial training and an outer loop to update local
model parameters. On the server side, FAL aggregates local model updates and
broadcast the aggregated model. We design a global robust training loss and
formulate FAL training as a min-max optimization problem. Unlike the
convergence analysis in classical centralized training that relies on the
gradient direction, it is significantly harder to analyze the convergence in
FAL for three reasons: 1) the complexity of min-max optimization, 2) model not
updating in the gradient direction due to the multi-local updates on the
client-side before aggregation and 3) inter-client heterogeneity. We address
these challenges by using appropriate gradient approximation and coupling
techniques and present the convergence analysis in the over-parameterized
regime. Our main result theoretically shows that the minimum loss under our
algorithm can converge to $\epsilon$ small with chosen learning rate and
communication rounds. It is noteworthy that our analysis is feasible for
non-IID clients.

The observations were taken with SINFONI and KMOS integral-field spectrographs
at ESO-VLT, LUCI at LBT, NOEMA at IRAM, and ALMA. We fit the major axis
kinematics with beam-convolved, forward models of turbulent rotating disks with
bulges embedded in dark matter (DM) halos, including the effects of pressure
support. The fraction of dark to total matter within the disk effective radius
($R_e ~ 5 kpc$), $f_DM (R_e)=V_{DM}^2 (R_e)/V_{circ}^2 (R_e)$, decreases with
redshift: At z~1 (z~2) the median DM fraction is $0.38\pm 0.23$ ($0.27\pm
0.18$), and a third (half) of all galaxies are ""maximal"" disks with $f_{DM}
(R_e)<0.28$. Dark matter fractions correlate inversely with the baryonic
surface density, and the low DM fractions require a flattened, or cored, inner
DM density distribution. At z~2 there is ~40% less dark matter mass on average
within $R_e$ compared to expected values based on cosmological stellar-mass
halo-mass relations. The DM deficit is more evident at high star formation rate
(SFR) surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR}>2.5 M_{\odot} yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}$) and
galaxies with massive bulges ($M_{bulge}>10^{10} M_{\odot}$). A combination of
stellar or active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and/or heating due to
dynamical friction, either from satellite accretion or clump migration, may
drive the DM from cuspy into cored mass distributions. The observations
plausibly indicate an efficient build-up of massive bulges and central black
holes at z~2 SFGs.

The inherent end-to-end trainability overcomes the requirement of separately
processing individual object instances. By calculating the mutual
Intersection-over-Unions, pose hypotheses are clustered into distinct
instances, which achieves negligible runtime overhead with respect to the
number of object instances. Results on multiple challenging standard datasets
show that the pose estimation performance is superior to single-model

Photoionization drives mass ejection; the recoil of cloud material both stirs
turbulent motions and leads to an effective confining pressure. The balance
between these effects and the decay of turbulent motions through isothermal
shocks determines clouds' dynamical and energetic evolution. We find that for
realistic values of the rates of turbulent dissipation, photoevaporation, and
energy injection by HII regions, the massive clouds where most molecular gas in
the Galaxy resides live for a few crossing times, in good agreement with recent
observational estimates that large clouds in local group galaxies survive
roughly 20-30 Myr. During this time clouds remain close to equilibrium, with
virial parameters of 1-3 and column densities near 10^22 H atoms cm^-2, also in
agreement with observed cloud properties. Over their lives they convert 5-10%

inverse problem occurs in nonlinear optics in the context of ultrashort laser
pulse characterization. The novelty of the mathematical model consists in a
physically required extension of the deautoconvolution problem beyond the
classical case usually discussed in literature: (i) For measurements of
ultrashort laser pulses with the self-diffraction SPIDER method, a stable
approximate solution of an autocovolution equation with a complex-valued kernel
function is needed. (ii) The considered scenario requires complex functions
both, in the solution and the rhs of the integral equation. Since, however,
noisy data are available not only for amplitude and phase functions of the rhs,
but also for the amplitude of the solution, the stable approximate
reconstruction of the associated smooth phase function represents the main goal
of the paper. An iterative regularization approach is described that is
specifically adapted to the physical situation in pulse characterization, using
a non-standard stopping rule for the iteration process of computing regularized
solutions. Our approach is illustrated by several case studies for synthetic
noisy data and physically realistic complex-valued kernel functions. Based on
an example with focus on amplitude perturbations, we show that the
autoconvolution equation is locally ill-posed everywhere. To date, the
analytical treatment of the impact of noisy data on phase perturbations remains
an open question. However, we show its influence with the help of numerical
experiments. Moreover, we formulate assertions on the non-uniqueness of the
complex-valued autoconvolution problem, at least for the simplified case of a
constant kernel. The presented results and figures associated with case studies
illustrate the ill-posedness phenomena also for the case of non-trivial complex
kernel functions.

  and Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}=200$ GeV","522 authors, 8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. Submitted to Phys. Rev.
  Lett. Plain text data tables for the points plotted in figures for this and
  previous PHENIX publications are (or will be) publicly available at
  http://www.phenix.bnl.gov/papers.html",,,,nucl-ex,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Two-pion interferometry measurements in $d$$+$Au and Au$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}=200$ GeV are used to extract and compare the Gaussian source
radii R$_{{\rm out}}$, R$_{{\rm side}}$, and R$_{{\rm long}}$, which
characterize the space-time extent of the emission sources. The comparisons,
which are performed as a function of collision centrality and the mean
transverse momentum for pion pairs, indicate strikingly similar patterns for
the $d$$+$Au and Au$+$Au systems. They also indicate a linear dependence of
R$_{{\rm side}}$ on the initial transverse geometric size $\bar{R}$, as well as
a smaller freeze-out size for the $d$$+$Au system. These patterns point to the
important role of final-state rescattering effects in the reaction dynamics of
$d$$+$Au collisions.

a ""superposition of orthogonal-building-blocks"" with significantly larger
contention space to enhance the massive machine-type communications (mMTC)
random access (RA) performance in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems.Specifically, the pattern-domain pilot is constructed based on the
superposition of $L$ cyclically-shifted Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. The
pattern-domain pilots exhibit zero correlation values between non-colliding
patterns from the same root and low correlation values between patterns from
different roots. The increased contention space, i.e., from N to
$\binom{N}{L}$, where $\binom{N}{L}$ denotes the number of all L-combinations
of a set N, and low correlation valueslead to a significantly lower pilot
collision probability without compromising excessively on channel estimation
performance for mMTC RA in massive MIMO systems.We present the framework and
analysis of the RA success probability of the pattern-domain based scheme with
massive MIMO systems.Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed pattern
division random access (PDRA) scheme achieves an appreciable performance gain
over the conventional one,while preserving the existing physical layer
virtually unchanged. The extension of the ""superposition of

the shadows of black holes of the Pleba\'nski class of metrics which are also
known as the Kerr--Newman--NUT--(anti-)deSitter metrics. These metrics are
characterized by six parameters: mass, spin, electric and magnetic charge,
gravitomagnetic NUT charge, and the cosmological constant. Here we extend this
analysis to the Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class of metrics which contains, in
addition to these six parameters, the so-called acceleration parameter. All
these metrics are axially symmetric and stationary type D solutions to the
Einstein--Maxwell equations with a cosmological constant. We derive analytical
formulas for the photon regions (i.e., for the regions that contain spherical
lightlike geodesics) and for the boundary curve of the shadow as it is seen by
an observer at Boyer--Lindquist coordinates $(r_O, \vartheta _O)$ in the domain
of outer communication. Whereas all relevant formulas are derived for the whole
Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class, we concentrate on the accelerated Kerr metric
(i.e., only mass, spin and acceleration parameter are different from zero) when
discussing the influence of the acceleration parameter on the photon region and
on the shadow in terms of pictures. The accelerated Kerr metric is also known
as the rotating $C$-metric. We discuss how our analytical formulas can be used
for calculating the horizontal and vertical angular diameters of the shadow and
we estimate these values for the black holes at the center of our Galaxy and at
the center of M87.

of estimating the distributions of eigenvalue estimators, or of functions of

type, but it is very sensitive to the choice of $m$. In this paper we propose a
new approach, where a tie diagnostic is used to determine the locations of

governed by a probability level, $\beta$, which in principle is an analogue of
$m$ in the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap. However, the tie-respecting bootstrap
(TRB) is remarkably robust against the choice of $\beta$. This makes the TRB
significantly more attractive than the $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap, where the
value of $m$ has substantial influence on the final result. The TRB can be used
very generally; for example, to test hypotheses about, or construct confidence
regions for, the proportion of variability explained by a set of principal
components. It is suitable for both finite-dimensional data and functional
data.

for applications with privacy-sensitive data. Without sharing data, FL trains
local models on individual devices and constructs the global model on the

cost, the participants in each training round are randomly selected, which
significantly decreases the training efficiency under data and device
heterogeneity. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that considers the data distribution and computational resources of
devices to select the clients for each training round. Our proposed method
performs client selection based on the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) theory by
considering available computational resources for each client, the training
loss, and weight divergence. To examine the usability of our proposed method,
we implement our contribution on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by using the

unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification. However, existing
methods perform contrastive learning on selected samples between teacher and
student networks, which is sensitive to noises in pseudo labels and neglects
the relationship among most samples. Moreover, these methods are not effective
in cooperation of different teacher networks. To handle these issues, this
paper proposes a Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching (GCMT) method with
constructing the Graph Consistency Constraint (GCC) between teacher and student
networks. Specifically, given unlabeled training images, we apply teacher
networks to extract corresponding features and further construct a teacher
graph for each teacher network to describe the similarity relationships among
training images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs
are fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT
fuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as
supervision and effectively optimizes student networks with more sample
relationships involved. Experiments on three datasets, i.e., Market-1501,
DukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17, show that proposed GCMT outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by clear margin. Specially, GCMT even outperforms the previous method
that uses a deeper backbone. Experimental results also show that GCMT can
effectively boost the performance with multiple teacher and student networks.

systems with $n$ nodes, of which up to $t$ are malicious (faulty), in addition
to a message adversary that can drop some of the messages sent by correct
(non-faulty) nodes.
  We present a Message-Adversary-Tolerant Byzantine Reliable Broadcast (MBRB)
algorithm that communicates an almost optimal amount of $O(|m|+n^2\kappa)$ bits
per node, where $|m|$ represents the length of the application message and
$\kappa=\Omega(\log n)$ is a security parameter. This improves upon the
state-of-the-art MBRB solution (Albouy, Frey, Raynal, and Ta\""iani, SSS 2021),
which incurs communication of $O(n|m|+n^2\kappa )$ bits per node.
  Our solution sends at most $4n^2$ messages overall, which is asymptotically
optimal. Reduced communication is achieved by employing coding techniques that
replace the need for all nodes to (re-)broadcast the entire message~$m$.
Instead, nodes forward authenticated fragments of the encoding of $m$ using an
erasure-correcting code. Under the cryptographic assumptions of PKI and
collision-resistant hash, and assuming $n > 3t + 2d$, where the adversary drops
at most~$d$ messages per broadcast, our algorithm allows most of the correct
nodes to reconstruct~$m$, despite missing fragments caused by the malicious
nodes and the message adversary.

events registered by the LIGO/Virgo detectors; and that there were no confident
excesses of gamma-ray emission over the background detected in any of >30 black
hole merger events recorded to the moment by these detectors. No hard X-ray
flares were detected in the field of view of the SPI and IBIS-ISGRI gamma-ray
telescopes aboard INTEGRAL. This, as well as the lack of detection of gamma-ray
emission from GRB190425 by the GBM monitor of the Fermi observatory assuming
its occultation by the Earth, can significantly reduce the localization area
for the source of this GW event. The estimates of the parameters E_{iso} and
E_{p} for GRB190425 are obtained and compared with the similar parameters for
GRB170817A.

promoting the spacetime coordinates themselves to operators which do not
commute. This approach is motivated, for example, from a quantum gravity
perspective, among others. Noncommutative gravity has been tested against the
binary black hole merger event GW150914. Here, we extend and improve upon such
a previous analysis by (i) relaxing an assumption made on the preferred
direction due to noncommutativity, (ii) using posterior samples produced by the
LIGO/Virgo Collaborations, (iii) consider other gravitational wave events,
namely GW151226, GW170608, GW170814 and GW170817, and (iv) consider binary
pulsar observations. Using Kepler's law that contains the noncommutative effect
at second post-Newtonian order, we derive corrections to the gravitational
waveform phase and the pericenter precession. Using the gravitational wave and
double pulsar binary observations, we find bounds on a space-time
noncommutative tensor $\theta^{0i}$ in terms of the preferred frame direction
with respect to the orientation of each binary. We find that the gravitational
wave bounds are stronger than the binary pulsar one by an order of magnitude
and the noncommutative tensor normalized by the Planck length and time is
constrained to be of order unity.

dust of the disk population in the Lupus clouds, in order to find indications
of dust evolution and possible correlations with other properties. We increase
up to 42 the number of disks of the region with measured CO and dust sizes
($R_{\mathrm{CO}}$, $R_{\mathrm{dust}}$) from observations with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The sizes are obtained from
modeling the ${^{12}}$CO $J = 2-1$ line emission and continuum emission at
$\sim 0.89$ mm with an empirical function (Nuker profile or Gaussian function).
The CO emission is more extended than the dust continuum, with a
$R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{CO}}$/$R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{dust}}$ median value of 2.5, for
the entire population and for a sub-sample with high completeness. 6 disks,
around $15\%$ of the Lupus disk population have a size ratio above 4. Based on
thermo-chemical modeling, this value can only be explained if the disk has
undergone grain growth and radial drift. These disks do not have unusual
properties in terms of stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), disk mass
($M_{\mathrm{disk}}$), CO and dust sizes ($R_{\mathrm{CO}}$,
$R_{\mathrm{dust}}$), and mass accretion. We search for correlations between
the size ratio and $M_{\star}$, $M_{\mathrm{disk}}$, $R_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and
$R_{\mathrm{dust}}$: only a weak monotonic anti-correlation with the
$R_{\mathrm{dust}}$ is found. The lack of strong correlations is remarkable and
suggests that the bulk of the population may be in a similar evolutionary
stage, independent of the stellar and disk properties. These results should be
further investigated, since the optical depth difference between CO and dust
continuum may play a role in the inferred size ratios. Lastly, the CO emission
for the majority of the disks is consistent with optically thick emission and
an average CO temperature of around 30 K.

unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection task, where they tend to
assign higher likelihoods to OOD samples. Previous studies on this issue are
usually not applicable to the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). As a popular
subclass of generative models, the VAE can be effective with a relatively
smaller model size and be more stable and faster in training and inference,
which can be more advantageous in real-world applications. In this paper, We
propose a novel VAE-based score called Error Reduction (ER) for OOD detection,
which is based on a VAE that takes a lossy version of the training set as
inputs and the original set as targets. Experiments are carried out on various
datasets to show the effectiveness of our method, we also present the effect of
design choices with ablation experiments. Our code is available at:
