Software specifically, is a well-known problem in the field. Still, little is
known yet about the large-scale extent and long-term trends that underpin the
phenomenon. We contribute to fill this gap by conducting a longitudinal study
of the population of contributors to publicly available software source code.
We analyze 1.6 billion commits corresponding to the development history of 120
million projects, contributed by 33 million distinct authors over a period of
50 years. We classify author names by gender and study their evolution over
time.We show that, while the amount of commits by female authors remains low
overall, there is evidence of a stable long-term increase in their proportion
over all contributions, providing hope of a more gender-balanced future for
collaborative software development.

of QCD factorization (QCDF). Considering two different scenarios for scalar
mesons above 1 GeV, we find that the data favor the scenario in which the
scalars $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ are the lowest lying $q\bar q$ bound
states. This in turn implies a preferred four-quark nature for light scalars
below 1 GeV. Assuming $K_0^*(1430)$ being a lowest lying $q\bar s$ state, we
show that the data of $B\to K_0^*(1430)\eta^{(')}$ and $B\to
K_0^*(1430)(\rho,\omega,\phi)$ can be accommodated in QCDF without introducing
power corrections induced from penguin annihilation, while the predicted
$B^-\to \ov K_0^{*0}(1430)\pi^-$ and $\ov B^0\to K_0^{*-}(1430)\pi^+$ are too
small compared to experiment. In principle, the data of $K_0^*(1430)\pi$ modes
can be explained if penguin-annihilation induced power corrections are taken
into account. However, this will destroy the agreement between theory and
experiment for $B\to K_0^*(1430)(\eta^{(')},\rho,\omega,\phi)$. Contrary to the
pseudoscalar meson sector where $B\to K\eta'$ has the largest rate in 2-body
decays of the $B$ meson, we show that $Br(B\to K_0^*\eta')<\B(B\to K_0^*\eta)$.
The decay $\ov B^0\to a_0(980)^+K^-$ is found to have a rate much smaller than
that of $\ov B^0\to a_0(980)^+\pi^-$ in QCDF, while it is the other way around
in pQCD. Experimental measurements of these two modes will help discriminate
between these two different approaches. Assuming 2-quark bound states for
$f_0(980)$ and $f_0(500)$, the observed large rates of $f_0(980)K$ and
$f_0(980)K^*$ modes can be explained in QCDF with the $f_0(980)\!-\!f_0(500)$

space. We first argue that the simplicity of prey-predator system is apparent
rather than real and there are still many of its hidden properties that have
been poorly studied or overlooked altogether. We further focus on the case
where, in the slow-fast system, the prey growth is affected by a weak Allee
effect. We first consider this system in the non-spatial case and make its
comprehensive study using a variety of mathematical techniques. In particular,
we show that the interplay between the Allee effect and the existence of
multiple timescales may lead to a regime shift where small-amplitude
oscillations in the population abundances abruptly change to large-amplitude
oscillations. We then consider the spatially explicit slow-fast prey-predator
system and reveal the effect of different time scales on the pattern formation.
We show that a decrease in the timescale ratio may lead to another regime shift
where the spatiotemporal pattern becomes spatially correlated leading to
large-amplitude oscillations in spatially average population densities and
potential species extinction.

allowing for operation in four configurations with the capability of sustained
hover in three. This is accomplished without requiring actuators beyond the
four motors typical of a quadcopter. Morphing is achieved through
freely-rotating hinges that allow the vehicle arms to fold downwards by either
reducing or reversing thrust forces. Constraints placed on the control inputs
of the vehicle prevent the arms from folding or unfolding unexpectedly. This
allows for the use of existing quadcopter controllers and trajectory generation
algorithms with only minimal added complexity. For our experimental vehicle at
hover, we find that these constraints result in a 36% reduction of the maximum
yaw torque the vehicle can produce, but do not result in a reduction of the
maximum thrust or roll and pitch torques. Experimental results show that, for a
typical maneuver, the added limits have a negligible effect on trajectory
tracking performance. Finally, the ability to change configurations is shown to
enable the vehicle to traverse small passages, perch on hanging wires, and
perform limited grasping tasks.

giant component exhibit supercritical behavior. By decreasing the control

imbalanced classification arising from many application domains where
high-dimensional sparse data is abundant. In such cases, each $d$ dimensional
sample has only $k$ non-zero features with $k \ll d$, and data arrives
sequentially in a streaming form. Current online AUC optimization algorithms
have high per-iteration cost $\mathcal{O}(d)$ and usually produce non-sparse
solutions in general, and hence are not suitable for handling the data
challenge mentioned above.
  In this paper, we aim to directly optimize the AUC score for high-dimensional
sparse datasets under online learning setting and propose a new algorithm,
\textsc{FTRL-AUC}. Our proposed algorithm can process data in an online fashion
with a much cheaper per-iteration cost $\mathcal{O}(k)$, making it amenable for
high-dimensional sparse streaming data analysis. Our new algorithmic design
critically depends on a novel reformulation of the U-statistics AUC objective
function as the empirical saddle point reformulation, and the innovative
introduction of the ""lazy update"" rule so that the per-iteration complexity is
dramatically reduced from $\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{O}(k)$. Furthermore,
\textsc{FTRL-AUC} can inherently capture sparsity more effectively by applying
a generalized Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework.
  Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsc{FTRL-AUC}
significantly improves both run time and model sparsity while achieving
competitive AUC scores compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Comparison
with the online learning method for logistic loss demonstrates that
\textsc{FTRL-AUC} achieves higher AUC scores especially when datasets are
imbalanced.

punishment on themselves if they fail to meet health goals present a promising
approach for encouraging healthier behavior. However, the element of choice
inherent in these schemes introduces concerns that only non-representative
sectors of the population will select aggressive incentives, leaving value on
the table for those who don't opt in. In a field experiment conducted over a 29
week period on individuals wearing Fitbit activity trackers, we find modest and
short lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of
aggressive incentives. In contrast, we find significant and persistent
increases for those assigned (oftentimes against their stated preference) to
the same aggressive incentives. The modest benefits for those provided a choice
seems to emerge because those who benefited most from the aggressive incentives
were the least likely to choose them, and it was those who did not need them
who opted in. These results are confirmed in a follow up lab experiment. We
also find that benefits to individuals assigned to aggressive incentives were
pronounced if they also updated their step target in the Fitbit mobile
application to match the new activity goal we provided them. Our findings have
important implications for incentive based interventions to improve health
behavior. For firms and policy makers, our results suggest that one effective
strategy for encouraging sustained healthy behavior combines exposure to
aggressive incentive schemes to jolt individuals out of their comfort zones
with technology decision aids that help individuals sustain this behavior after
incentives end.

mechanics when Bethe solved the famous Heisenberg model that describes quantum
behaviour in magnetic systems. In the last decade, one-dimensional systems have
become a forefront area of research driven by the realization of the
Tonks-Girardeau gas using cold atomic gases. Here we prove that one-dimensional
fermionic and bosonic systems with strong short-range interactions are solvable
in arbitrary confining geometries by introducing a new energy-functional
technique and obtaining the full spectrum of energies and eigenstates. As a
first application, we calculate spatial correlations and show how both ferro-
and anti-ferromagnetic states are present already for small system sizes that
are prepared and studied in current experiments. Our work demonstrates the
enormous potential for quantum manipulation of magnetic correlations at the
microscopic scale.

observed during a campaign focused on the gamma-ray binary PSR B1259-63 and was

for accreting X-ray pulsars, consisting of a simple power law with an
exponential cutoff starting at ~7 keV with a folding energy of E_fold=~18 keV.
There is also an indication of the presence of a 6.4 keV iron line in the

pulsation period reveal that the pulsar has undergone a strong and steady
spin-up for the last 20 years. The pulsed fraction is estimated to be ~80%, and
is constant with energy up to 40 keV. The power density spectrum shows a break
towards higher frequencies relative to the current spin period. This, together
with steady persistent luminosity, points to a long-term mass accretion rate
high enough to bring the pulsar out of spin equilibrium.

wave state featuring anomalous quantum Hall effect and the d+id superconductor
--- were proposed for the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice at 1/4 doping.
Using a combination of exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization
group, the variational Monte Carlo method and quantum field theories, we study
the quantum phase diagrams of both the Hubbard model and t-J model on the
honeycomb lattice at 1/4-doping. The main advantage of our approach is the use
of symmetry quantum numbers of ground state wavefunctions on finite size
systems (up to 32 sites) to sharply distinguish different quantum phases. Our
results show that for $1\lesssim U/t< 40$ in the Hubbard model and for $0.1<
J/t<0.80(2)$ in the t-J model, the quantum ground state is either a chiral spin
density wave state or a spin-charge-Chern liquid, but not a d+id
superconductor. However, in the t-J model, upon increasing $J$ the system goes
through a first-order phase transition at $J/t=0.80(2)$ into the d+id
superconductor. Here the spin-charge-Chern liquid state is a new type of
topologically ordered quantum phase with Abelian anyons and fractionalized
excitations. Experimental signatures of these quantum phases, such as tunneling
conductance, are calculated. These results are discussed in the context of
1/4-doped graphene systems and other correlated electronic materials on the

devoted to problems of the type $\max\{c^\top x \colon A x = b,\, x \in
\mathbb{Z}^n_{\geq 0}\}$, where all the entries of $A,b,c$ are integer,
parameterized by the number of rows of $A$ and $\|A\|_{\max}$. This class of
problems is known under the name of ILP problems in the standard form, adding
the word ""bounded"" if $x \leq u$, for some integer vector $u$. Recently, many
new sparsity, proximity, and complexity results were obtained for bounded and
unbounded ILP problems in the standard form.
  In this paper, we consider ILP problems in the canonical form $$\max\{c^\top
x \colon b_l \leq A x \leq b_r,\, x \in \mathbb{Z}^n\},$$ where $b_l$ and $b_r$
are integer vectors. We assume that the integer matrix $A$ has the rank $n$,
$(n + m)$ rows, $n$ columns, and parameterize the problem by $m$ and
$\Delta(A)$, where $\Delta(A)$ is the maximum of $n \times n$ sub-determinants
of $A$, taken in the absolute value. We show that any ILP problem in the
standard form can be polynomially reduced to some ILP problem in the canonical
form, preserving $m$ and $\Delta(A)$, but the reverse reduction is not always
possible. More precisely, we define the class of generalized ILP problems in
the standard form, which includes an additional group constraint, and prove the
equivalence to ILP problems in the canonical form.
  We generalize known sparsity, proximity, and complexity bounds for ILP
problems in the canonical form. Additionally, sometimes, we strengthen
previously known results for ILP problems in the canonical form, and,
sometimes, we give shorter proofs. Finally, we consider the special cases of $m
\in \{0,1\}$. By this way, we give specialised sparsity, proximity, and
complexity bounds for the problems on simplices, Knapsack problems and
Subset-Sum problems.

Ethier (2010) and given its name by Epstein (2013). The eight-card deck
comprises two aces, two deuces, and four treys, with aces having value either 1
or 4, and deuces and treys having values 2 and 3, respectively. The target
total is 7 (vs. 21 in blackjack), and ace-trey is a natural. The dealer stands
on 6 and 7, including soft totals, and otherwise hits. The player can stand,
hit, double, or split, but split pairs receive only one card per paircard (like
split aces in blackjack), and there is no insurance.
  We analyze the game, both single and multiple deck, deriving basic strategy
and one-parameter card-counting systems. Unlike in blackjack, these derivations
can be done by hand, though it may nevertheless be easier and more reliable to
use a computer. More importantly, the simplicity of snackjack allows us to do
computations that would be prohibitively time-consuming at blackjack. We can
thereby enhance our understanding of blackjack by thoroughly exploring
snackjack.

have been filled up with fruit and vegetable residues. The anodes were realized
by means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a
graphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The
performances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed
according to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate
water dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,
finally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.
  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was
carried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a
Power Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$ and
a maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \cdot$kg$_{\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic

  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very
likely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our
reactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to
actual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to
characterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the
global TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable
alternative to anaerobic digestion technologies.

show that a (large) random geometric graph is a lateration graph with high

a variety of vision tasks and are being used as an alternative to CNNs. Their
design is based on a self-attention mechanism that processes images as a
sequence of patches, which is quite different compared to CNNs. Hence it is
interesting to study if ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor
attacks happen when an attacker poisons a small part of the training data for
malicious purposes. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the
attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at
test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that ViTs are
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. We also find an intriguing difference between
ViTs and CNNs - interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on
test images for ViTs but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we propose a
test-time image blocking defense for ViTs which reduces the attack success rate
by a large margin. Code is available here:

they are strong candidate to control both optical micro- and macroscale
structures, namely spin (circular polarization) and orbital angular momentum
(spiral wavefront), respectively. Here, we show structured high harmonic
generation linked to the anisotropic symmetry of a solid. By strategically
preserving a dynamical symmetry arising from the spin-orbit interaction of
light, we generate multiple orbital angular momentum states in high-order
harmonics. The experimental results exhibit the total angular momentum
conservation rule of light even in the extreme nonlinear region, which is
evidence that the mechanism originates from a dynamical symmetry. Our study
provides a deeper understanding of multiscale nonlinear optical phenomena and a
general guideline for using electronic structure to control structured light,
such as through Floquet engineering.

are highly capable of 'learning' these radial velocities as a function of the
other five coordinates, and thus filling in the gaps. For a given star, the
network outputs are not merely point predictions, but full posterior
distributions encompassing the intrinsic scatter of the stellar phase space
distribution, the observational uncertainties on the network inputs, and any
'epistemic' uncertainty stemming from our ignorance about the stellar phase
space distribution. Applying this technique to the real Gaia data, we generate
and publish a catalogue of posteriors (median width: 25 km/s) for the radial
velocities of 16 million Gaia DR2/EDR3 stars in the magnitude range 6<G<14.5.
Many of these gaps will be filled in very soon by Gaia DR3, which will serve to
test our blind predictions. Thus, the primary use of our published catalogue
will be to validate our method, justifying its future use in generating an

remain vulnerable to malicious activities, notably poisoning attacks. These
attacks involve injecting malicious data into the training datasets of RS,
thereby compromising their integrity and manipulating recommendation outcomes
for gaining illicit profits. This survey paper provides a systematic and

Recommendation (PAR). A novel and comprehensive taxonomy is proposed,
categorizing existing PAR methodologies into three distinct categories:
Component-Specific, Goal-Driven, and Capability Probing. For each category, we
discuss its mechanism in detail, along with associated methods. Furthermore,
this paper highlights potential future research avenues in this domain.
Additionally, to facilitate and benchmark the empirical comparison of PAR, we
introduce an open-source library, ARLib, which encompasses a comprehensive
collection of PAR models and common datasets. The library is released at

a given set of predictions'? To answer this question, we make use of Fisher
kernels as the defining feature embedding of each data point, combined with
Sequential Bayesian Quadrature (SBQ) for efficient selection of examples. In
contrast to prior work, our method is able to seamlessly handle any sized
subset of test predictions in a principled way. We theoretically analyze our
approach, providing novel convergence bounds for SBQ over discrete candidate
atoms. Our approach recovers the application of influence functions for
interpretability as a special case yielding novel insights from this
connection. We also present applications of the proposed approach to three use
cases: cleaning training data, fixing mislabeled examples and data

  Correlation Functions","38 pages, 32 figures, 4 tables (PRD in press.)",,,,astro-ph.CO,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We perform a blinded cosmology analysis with cosmic shear two-point
correlation functions (2PCFs) measured from more than 25 million galaxies in
the Hyper Suprime-Cam three-year shear catalog in four tomographic redshift
bins ranging from 0.3 to 1.5. After conservative masking and galaxy selection,
the survey covers 416 deg$^2$ of the northern sky with an effective galaxy
number density of 15 arcmin$^{-2}$ over the four redshift bins. The 2PCFs
adopted for cosmology analysis are measured in the angular range: $7.1 <
\theta/{\rm arcmin} < 56.6$ for $\xi_+$ and $31.2 <\theta/{\rm arcmin} < 248$
for $\xi_-$, with a total signal-to-noise ratio of 26.6. We apply a
conservative, wide, flat prior on the photometric redshift errors on the last
two tomographic bins, and the relative magnitudes of the cosmic shear amplitude
across four redshift bins allow us to calibrate the photometric redshift
errors. With this flat prior on redshift errors, we find $\Omega_{\rm
m}=0.256_{-0.044}^{+0.056}$ and $S_8\equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3}=0.769_{-0.034}^{+0.031}$ (both 68\% CI) for a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter cosmology. We find, after unblinding, that our constraint on $S_8$ is
consistent with the Fourier space cosmic shear and the 3$\times$2pt analyses on
the same HSC dataset. We carefully study the potential systematics from
astrophysical and systematic model uncertainties in our fiducial analysis using
synthetic data, and report no biases (including projection bias in the
posterior space) greater than $0.5\sigma$ in the estimation of $S_8$. Our
analysis hints that the mean redshifts of the two highest tomographic bins are
higher than initially estimated. In addition, a number of consistency tests are
conducted to assess the robustness of our analysis. Comparing our result with
Planck-2018 cosmic microwave background observations, we find a ~$2\sigma$
tension for the $\Lambda$CDM model.

necessary when the squared noise matrices may overwhelm the signal in the very
sparse regime. The analysis of our method relies on several novel tail

microring cavities with different free-spectral ranges (FSRs) in a
configuration wherein they are coupled by ""far-field"" interference in a shared
radiation channel. A novel Vernier-like effect for laser resonators is designed
where only one longitudinal resonant mode has a lower loss than the small
signal gain and can achieve lasing while all other modes are suppressed. This
configuration enables ultra-widely tunable single-frequency lasers based on
either homogeneously or inhomogeneously broadened gain media. The concept is an
alternative to the common external cavity configurations for achieving tunable
single-mode operation in a laser. The proposed laser concept builds on a high-Q

operational and security challenges in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems
(DCCS). Implementing centralized ZT architecture is seen as unsuitable for the
computing continuum (e.g., computing entities with limited connectivity and
visibility, etc.). At the same time, implementing decentralized ZT in the
computing continuum requires understanding infrastructure limitations and novel
approaches to enhance resource access management decisions. To overcome such
challenges, we present a novel learning-driven ZT conceptual architecture
designed for DCCS. We aim to enhance ZT architecture service quality by
incorporating lightweight learning strategies such as Representation Learning
(ReL) and distributing ZT components across the computing continuum. The ReL
helps to improve the decision-making process by predicting threats or untrusted
requests. Through an illustrative example, we show how the learning process
detects and blocks the requests, enhances resource access control, and reduces
network and computation overheads. Lastly, we discuss the conceptual
architecture, processes, and provide a research agenda.

industry faces. Alibaba's return-freight insurance, providing return-shipping
postage compensations over product return on the e-commerce platform, receives
thousands of potentially fraudulent claims every day. Such deliberate abuse of
the insurance policy could lead to heavy financial losses. In order to detect
and prevent fraudulent insurance claims, we developed a novel data-driven
procedure to identify groups of organized fraudsters, one of the major
contributions to financial losses, by learning network information. In this
paper, we introduce a device-sharing network among claimants, followed by
developing an automated solution for fraud detection based on graph learning
algorithms, to separate fraudsters from regular customers and uncover groups of
organized fraudsters. This solution applied at Alibaba achieves more than 80%
precision while covering 44% more suspicious accounts compared with a
previously deployed rule-based classifier after human expert investigations.
Our approach can easily and effectively generalizes to other types of
insurance.

come to a forefront in recent years, in both the security community and the
privacy community. However, one big limitation of previous research is that the
security domain and the privacy domain have typically been considered
separately. It is thus unclear whether the defense methods in one domain will
have any unexpected impact on the other domain.
  In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this limitation by combining
the two domains. In particular, we measure the success of membership inference
attacks against six state-of-the-art defense methods that mitigate the risk of
adversarial examples (i.e., evasion attacks). Membership inference attacks
determine whether or not an individual data record has been part of a model's
training set. The accuracy of such attacks reflects the information leakage of
training algorithms about individual members of the training set. Adversarial
defense methods against adversarial examples influence the model's decision
boundaries such that model predictions remain unchanged for a small area around
each input. However, this objective is optimized on training data. Thus,
individual data records in the training set have a significant influence on
robust models. This makes the models more vulnerable to inference attacks.
  To perform the membership inference attacks, we leverage the existing
inference methods that exploit model predictions. We also propose two new
inference methods that exploit structural properties of robust models on
adversarially perturbed data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that
compared with the natural training (undefended) approach, adversarial defense
methods can indeed increase the target model's risk against membership
inference attacks.

The characteristic way it behaves describe how the system fluctuates, and much
of the progress achieved to understand complex systems has been due to their
study. Of particular interest in polymer science are the space correlations
which describe its mechanical behavior. In this work I study the stiffness of a
polymer immersed in a magnetic medium and trapped in an optical tweezers. Using
Monte Carlo simulations the correlation function along the chain and the force
in the tweezers are obtained as a function of temperature and density of
magnetic particles. The results show that the correlation decay has two
regimes: an initial very fast decay of order the monomer-monomer spacing and a
power law in the long distance regime. The power law exponent has a minimum at
a temperature $T_{min}$ for any non zero density of magnetic particles
indicating that the system is more correlated in this region. Using a formula
for the persistence length derived from the WLC theory one observed that it has
a maximum at the same temperature. These results suggest that the correlations

frequencies seen in the broad band power spectra from black hole and neutron
star binaries. We use the truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry, and assume
that the hot flow is generically turbulent. Each radius in the hot flow
produces fluctuations, and we further assume that these are damped on the
viscous frequency. Integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noise
power between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscous
timescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.
Lense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes the
low frequency QPO on this continuum power.
  We test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems
(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) kHz QPO most likely
independently tracks the truncation radius. These show that this model can give
a consistent solution, with the truncation radius decreasing from 20-8 Rg while
the inner radius of the flow remains approximately constant at ~4.5 Rg i.e. 9.2
km. We use this very constrained geometry to predict the low frequency QPO from
Lense-Thirring precession of the entire hot flow from r_o to r_i. The simplest
assumption of a constant surface density in the hot flow matches the observed
QPO frequency to within 25 per cent. This match can be made even better by
considering that the surface density should become increasingly centrally
concentrated as the flow collapses into an optically thick boundary layer
during the spectral transition. The success of the model opens up the way to
use the broad band power spectra as a diagnostic of accretion flows in strong
gravity.

associated with a projection operator onto the third state. We perform an
in-depth analytical and numerical analysis of the coherent protocol, where
coherent interaction between the object and the detector replaces the
projective operators, resulting in higher detection efficiencies. We provide
approximate asymptotic analytical results to support this finding. We find that
our protocol reaches the Heisenberg limit when evaluating the Fisher
information at small strengths of the pulses we aim to detect -- in contrast to
the projective protocol that can only reach the standard quantum limit. We also
demonstrate that the coherent protocol remains remarkably robust under errors

decompose two or more genomes into syntenic blocks that are segments of
homologous chromosomes. For the reliable recovery of syntenic blocks, noise and
ambiguities in the genomic maps need to be removed first. Maximal Strip
Recovery (MSR) is an optimization problem proposed by Zheng, Zhu, and Sankoff
for reliably recovering syntenic blocks from genomic maps in the midst of noise
and ambiguities. Given $d$ genomic maps as sequences of gene markers, the
objective of \msr{d} is to find $d$ subsequences, one subsequence of each
genomic map, such that the total length of syntenic blocks in these
subsequences is maximized. For any constant $d \ge 2$, a polynomial-time
2d-approximation for \msr{d} was previously known. In this paper, we show that
for any $d \ge 2$, \msr{d} is APX-hard, even for the most basic version of the
problem in which all gene markers are distinct and appear in positive
orientation in each genomic map. Moreover, we provide the first explicit lower
bounds on approximating \msr{d} for all $d \ge 2$. In particular, we show that
\msr{d} is NP-hard to approximate within $\Omega(d/\log d)$. From the other
direction, we show that the previous 2d-approximation for \msr{d} can be
optimized into a polynomial-time algorithm even if $d$ is not a constant but is
part of the input. We then extend our inapproximability results to several
related problems including \cmsr{d}, \gapmsr{\delta}{d}, and
\gapcmsr{\delta}{d}.

lemma for $\Gn$. It is easy to verify that $\mathbb G_n=\widetilde{\mathbb

COCONUT, which aims at providing fast and accurate inputs for space weather
forecast as an alternative to empirical models. We use all 20 available
magnetic maps of the solar photosphere covering the date of the 2nd of July
2019 which corresponds to a solar eclipse on Earth. We use the same standard
pre-processing on all maps, then perform coronal MHD simulations with the same
numerical and physical parameters. In the end, we quantify the performance for
each map using three indicators from remote-sensing observations: white-light
total solar eclipse images for the streamers' edges, EUV synoptic maps for
coronal holes and white-light coronagraph images for the heliospheric current
sheet. We discuss the performance for space weather forecasts and we show that
the choice of the input magnetic map has a strong impact. We find performances
between 24% to 85% for the streamers' edges, 24% to 88% for the coronal hole
boundaries and a mean deviation between 4 to 12 degrees for the heliospheric
current sheet position. We find that the HMI runs are globally performing
better on all indicators, with the GONG-ADAPT being the second-best choice. HMI
runs perform better for the streamers' edges, GONG-ADAPT for polar coronal
holes, HMI synchronic for equatorial coronal holes and for the streamer belt.
We especially showcase the importance of the filling of the poles. This
demonstrates that the solar poles have to be taken into account even for
ecliptic plane previsions.

supporting the results obtained from clustering studies of AGN. By examining
the temperature and density distribution of the gas in the vicinity of AGN we
show that due to feedback from the central engine, the gas gets displaced from
the centre of the group/cluster resulting in a reduction of the density but an
enhancement of temperature. We show that these effects are pronounced at both
high and low redshifts and propose new observables to study the effect of

terms of a twist form, encoding the twisting around of space-time due to a
rotating mass, and an axial vector. If the axial vector is a coordinate vector
and has vanishing transverse divergence, it can be uniquely specified under
certain generic conditions. Along a trapping horizon, a conservation law
expresses the rate of change of angular momentum of a general black hole in
terms of angular momentum densities of matter and gravitational radiation. This
identifies the transverse-normal block of an effective gravitational-radiation
energy tensor, whose normal-normal block was recently identified in a
corresponding energy conservation law. Angular momentum and energy are dual
respectively to the axial vector and a previously identified vector, the
conservation equations taking the same form. Including charge conservation, the
three conserved quantities yield definitions of an effective energy, electric
potential, angular velocity and surface gravity, satisfying a dynamical version
of the so-called first law of black-hole mechanics. A corresponding zeroth law
holds for null trapping horizons, resolving an ambiguity in taking the null

different domains (e.g., types of products) with overlapping users/items and is
common for platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, and LinkedIn that host multiple
services. Existing MDR models face two challenges: First, it is difficult to
disentangle knowledge that generalizes across domains (e.g., a user likes cheap
items) and knowledge specific to a single domain (e.g., a user likes blue
clothing but not blue cars). Second, they have limited ability to transfer
knowledge across domains with small overlaps. We propose a new MDR method named
EDDA with two key components, i.e., embedding disentangling recommender and
domain alignment, to tackle the two challenges respectively. In particular, the
embedding disentangling recommender separates both the model and embedding for
the inter-domain part and the intra-domain part, while most existing MDR
methods only focus on model-level disentangling. The domain alignment leverages
random walks from graph processing to identify similar user/item pairs from
different domains and encourages similar user/item pairs to have similar
embeddings, enhancing knowledge transfer. We compare EDDA with 12
state-of-the-art baselines on 3 real datasets. The results show that EDDA
consistently outperforms the baselines on all datasets and domains. All

techniques are needed to facilitate tall towers that are low-weight and cost
effective, but in effect more flexible. Such soft-soft tower configurations
generally have their fundamental side-side frequency in the below-rated
operational domain. Because the turbine rotor practically has or develops a
mass imbalance over time, a periodic and rotor-speed dependent side-side
excitation is present during below-rated operation. Persistent operation at the
coinciding tower and rotational frequency degrades the expected structural life
span. To reduce this effect, earlier work has shown the effectiveness of active
tower damping control strategies using collective pitch control. A more passive
approach is frequency skipping by inclusion of speed exclusion zones, which
avoids prolonged operation near the critical frequency. However, neither of the
methods incorporate a convenient way of performing a trade-off between energy
maximization and fatigue load minimization. Therefore, this paper introduces a
quasi-linear parameter varying model predictive control (qLPV-MPC) scheme,
exploiting the beneficial (convex) properties of a qLPV system description. The
qLPV model is obtained by a demodulation transformation, and is subsequently
augmented with a simple wind turbine model. Results show the effectiveness of
the algorithm in synthetic and realistic simulations using the NREL 5-MW
reference wind turbine in high-fidelity simulation code. Prolonged rotor speed
operation at the tower side-side natural frequency is prevented, whereas when
the trade-off is in favor of energy production, the algorithm decides to
rapidly pass over the natural frequency to attain higher rotor speeds and power
productions.

on the well-known Wolfe conditions that are used to ensure the convergence and
stability of unconstrained optimization algorithms. The directions to search
for fixed points are generated by using the ideas of the steepest descent
direction and conventional nonlinear conjugate gradient directions for
unconstrained optimization. We perform convergence as well as convergence rate
analyses on the algorithms for solving the fixed point problem under certain
assumptions. The main contribution of this paper is to make a concrete response
to an issue of constrained smooth convex optimization; that is, whether or not
we can devise nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithms to solve constrained

algorithms include ones with nonlinear conjugate gradient directions which can
solve constrained smooth convex optimization problems. To illustrate the
practicality of the algorithms, we apply them to concrete constrained smooth
convex optimization problems, such as constrained quadratic programming
problems and generalized convex feasibility problems, and numerically compare
them with previous algorithms based on the Krasnosel'ski\u\i-Mann fixed point
algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithms dramatically reduce

wave energy harvesting, named the 'sloshing wave energy converter (S-WEC)'.
When the tank is oscillated by external loads (such as ocean waves), internal
liquid sloshing is activated, and the mechanical energy of sloshing waves can
be absorbed by the power take-off (PTO) system attached to these buoys. A
fully-nonlinear numerical model is established based on the boundary element
method for a systematic investigation on dynamic properties of the proposed
S-WEC. A motion decoupling algorithm based on auxiliary functions is developed
to solve the nonlinear interaction of sloshing waves and floating buoys in the
tank. An artificial damping model is introduced to reflect viscous effects of
the sloshing liquid. Physical experiments are carried out on a scaled S-WEC
model to validate the mathematical and numerical methodologies. Natural
frequencies of the S-WEC system are first investigated through spectrum
analyses on motion histories of the buoy and sloshing liquid. The viscous
damping strength is identified through comparisons with experimental
measurements. Effects of the PTO damping on power generation characteristics of
S-WEC is further explored. An optimal PTO damping can be found for each
excitation frequency, leading to the maximisation of both the power generation
and conversion efficiency of the buoy. To determine a constant PTO damping for
engineering design, a practical approach based on diagram analyses is proposed.
Effects of the buoy's geometry on power generation characteristics of the S-WEC
are also investigated. In engineering practice, the present design of S-WEC can
be a promising technical solution of ocean wave energy harvesting, based on its
comprehensive advantages on survivability enhancement, metal corrosion or
fouling organism inhibition, power generation stability and efficiency, and so
on.

  Methods and Empirical Wavelets",,,,,cs.CV,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology, it is important to be able
to functionalize surfaces chemically for a wide variety of applications.
Scanning tunneling microscopes (STMs) are important instruments in this area
used to measure the surface structure and chemistry with better than molecular
resolution. Self-assembly is frequently used to create monolayers that redefine
the surface chemistry in just a single-molecule-thick layer. Indeed, STM images
reveal rich information about the structure of self-assembled monolayers since
they convey chemical and physical properties of the studied material.
  In order to assist in and to enhance the analysis of STM and other images, we
propose and demonstrate an image-processing framework that produces two image
segmentations: one is based on intensities (apparent heights in STM images) and
the other is based on textural patterns. The proposed framework begins with a
cartoon+texture decomposition, which separates an image into its cartoon and
texture components. Afterward, the cartoon image is segmented by a modified
multiphase version of the local Chan-Vese model, while the texture image is
segmented by a combination of 2D empirical wavelet transform and a clustering
algorithm. Overall, our proposed framework contains several new features,
specifically in presenting a new application of cartoon+texture decomposition
and of the empirical wavelet transforms and in developing a specialized
framework to segment STM images and other data. To demonstrate the potential of
our approach, we apply it to actual STM images of cyanide monolayers on
Au\{111\} and present their corresponding segmentation results.

glaucoma, in 65,680 Europeans in the UK Biobank (UKB). A GWAS of ML-based VCDR
identified 299 independent genome-wide significant (GWS; $P\leq5\times10^{-8}$)
hits in 156 loci. The ML-based GWAS replicated 62 of 65 GWS loci from a recent
VCDR GWAS in the UKB for which two ophthalmologists manually labeled images for
67,040 Europeans. The ML-based GWAS also identified 92 novel loci,
significantly expanding our understanding of the genetic etiologies of glaucoma
and VCDR. Pathway analyses support the biological significance of the novel
hits to VCDR, with select loci near genes involved in neuronal and synaptic
biology or known to cause severe Mendelian ophthalmic disease. Finally, the
ML-based GWAS results significantly improve polygenic prediction of VCDR and
primary open-angle glaucoma in the independent EPIC-Norfolk cohort.

way to achieve this is to use dualities, because they are non-local
transformations that preserve the topological properties of the system. By
using them, we demonstrate that topological pumping of kinks and cluster-like
excitations can be realized. We find that the entanglement of these
highly-correlated excitations is strongly modified during the pumping process
and the interactions enhance the robustness against disorder. Our work paves
the way to explore topological pumping beyond the notion of particles and opens
a new avenue to investigate the relation between correlations and topology.

an efficient randomized coordinate descent method to solve this type of

means of simulations of the perturbed evolution, which agree with results
produced by the linear-stability analysis for small perturbations. Distinct
evolution scenarios are identified for unstable solitons. Generally, they
suffer blowup or decay, while weakly unstable solitons transform into
breathers. Due to a regularizing effect of SOC, stationary solitons are also
found beyond the exceptional point, at which the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaks
down, but they are unstable. Interactions between adjacent solitons are

calculating the radial metallicity gradients from orbit properties, which are
obtained for axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric potential models, of red clump

Distances are obtained by assuming a single absolute magnitude value in
near-infrared, i.e. $M_{Ks}=-1.54\pm0.04$ mag, for each RC star. Stellar orbit
parameters are calculated by using the potential functions: (i) for the
MWPotential2014 potential, (ii) for the same potential with perturbation
functions of the Galactic bar and transient spiral arms. The stellar age is
calculated with a method based on Bayesian statistics. The radial metallicity
gradients are evaluated based on the maximum vertical distance ($z_{max}$) from
the Galactic plane and the planar eccentricity ($e_p$) of RC stars for both of
the potential models. The largest radial metallicity gradient in the $0<z_{max}
\leq0.5$ kpc distance interval is $-0.065\pm0.005$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ for a
subsample with $e_p\leq0.1$, while the lowest value is $-0.014\pm0.006$ dex
kpc$^{-1}$ for the subsample with $e_p\leq0.5$. We find that at $z_{max}>1$
kpc, the radial metallicity gradients have zero or positive values and they do
not depend on $e_p$ subsamples. There is a large radial metallicity gradient
for thin disc, but no radial gradient found for thick disc. Moreover, the
largest radial metallicity gradients are obtained where the outer Lindblad
resonance region is effective. We claim that this apparent change in radial
metallicity gradients in the thin disc is a result of orbital perturbation
originating from the existing resonance regions.

quantum Hall states that may provide a new avenue toward manipulating
non-abelian excitations. Early theoretical studies have predicted their
existence in systems with energetically flat Chern bands and highlighted the
critical role of a particular quantum band geometry. Thus far, however, FCI
states have only been observed in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene aligned with
hexagonal boron nitride (BLG/hBN), in which a very large magnetic field is
responsible for the existence of the Chern bands, precluding the realization of
FCIs at zero field and limiting its potential for applications. By contrast,
magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) supports flat Chern bands at zero
magnetic field, and therefore offers a promising route toward stabilizing
zero-field FCIs. Here we report the observation of eight FCI states at low
magnetic field in MATBG enabled by high-resolution local compressibility
measurements. The first of these states emerge at 5 T, and their appearance is
accompanied by the simultaneous disappearance of nearby topologically-trivial
charge density wave states. Unlike the BLG/hBN platform, we demonstrate that
the principal role of the weak magnetic field here is merely to redistribute
the Berry curvature of the native Chern bands and thereby realize a quantum
band geometry favorable for the emergence of FCIs. Our findings strongly
suggest that FCIs may be realized at zero magnetic field and pave the way for
the exploration and manipulation of anyonic excitations in moir\'e systems with
native flat Chern bands.

for Langevin algorithms depend on the dimensionality of the problem, whereas
the convergence rates for optimization are dimension-free for convex problems.
Whether a dimension independent convergence rate can be achieved by Langevin
algorithm is thus a long-standing open problem. This paper provides an
affirmative answer to this problem for large classes of either Lipschitz or

efficient conversion of solar energy into useful electrical energy.
Metasurfaces can, not only be used to absorb solar energy efficiently but, they
do so with thickness of structure in nano-scale -effectively reducing the size

developed which give better absorbance on narrow/wide frequency spectrum. These
absorbers are fashioned with variable structures employing variable materials
but still, perfect absorbance is not attained with a simple two-dimensional

realization of a broadband metasurface absorber based on tungsten
nano-structure. The design is two-dimensional, polarization insensitive,
broadband and is predicted to give better response under high temperatures
ascribed to high melting point of tungsten i.e. 3422{\deg}C. Cross alignment is
found optimum for tungsten as it is impedance matched with the free space for
visible spectrum. This cross arrangement is further tweaked by changing span,
width and height of the cross resulting in 7 different optimized solutions
giving an average absorbance greater than 98%. One, amongst these solutions,
gave a maximum average absorbance of 99.3%.

power delivery systems with penetration surge in the past decade. Therefore,
accurately assessing their impact plays a crucial role in managing grid assets

impulsive, which means they are of high power density and vary in a fast and
discrete manner. These load characteristics make conventional assessment
methods unsuitable. This paper proposes an algorithm, which captures the
inter-temporal response of grid assets and allows fast assessment through an
integrated interface. To realize these advantageous features, we establish
analytical models for two generic classes of grid assets (continuous and
discrete operating assets) and recast their cost functions in the statistical
settings of PEV charging. Distinct from simulation-based methods, the proposed
method is analytical, and thus greatly reduce the computation resources and
data required for accurate assessment. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated on a set of power distribution networks in
Columbus metropolitan area, in comparison with the conventional assessment
methods.

uncertainties on the extent of these cores and thus on stellar ages. Our aim is
to use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores
in a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for
having a convective core. We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that
was proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores
using the so-called $r_{010}$ ratios, which are built with $l=0$ and $l=1$
modes. We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets
to optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we compute
grids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes, where
the extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous
mixing or as a diffusion process. Among the selected targets, we are able to
unambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic
measurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good
agreement between the CESAM2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using
the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of
extra-mixing beyond the core that is required in CESAM2k to reproduce seismic
observations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose
a calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription
chosen for the extra-mixing, but we find that it should be valid also for the
code MESA, provided the same prescription is used. This study constitutes a
first step towards the calibration of the extension of convective cores in
low-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these
stars.

transition at $T_{N}$ = 7~K. The magnetic order below this temperature exhibits

regions in the crystal with a 2-layer stacking sequence. The best fit symmetry
allowed magnetic structure of the as-grown crystals shows that the spins lie in
the $ac$-plane, with a zigzag configuration in each honeycomb layer. The three
layer repeat out-of-plane structure can be refined as a 120$^o$ spiral order or

  (ApJ)",,,,astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  To investigate gravity in the non-linear regime of cosmic structure using
measurements from Stage-IV surveys, it is imperative to accurately compute
large-scale structure observables, such as non-linear matter power spectra, for
gravity models that extend beyond general relativity. However, the theoretical
predictions of non-linear observables are typically derived from N-body
simulations, which demand substantial computational resources. In this study,
we introduce a novel public emulator, termed FREmu, designed to provide rapid
and precise forecasts of non-linear power spectra specifically for the
Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model across scales $0.0089 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}<k<0.5
h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshifts $0<z<3$. FREmu leverages Principal Component
Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks to establish a mapping from parameters
to power spectra, utilizing training data derived from the Quijote-MG
simulation suite. With a parameter space encompassing 7 dimensions, including
$\Omega_m$, $\Omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sigma_8$, $M_{\nu}$ and $f_{R_0}$, the
emulator achieves an accuracy exceeding 95% for the majority of cases, thus
proving to be highly efficient for constraining parameters.

unseen, high-dimensional meshes with thousands of vertices. To obtain stable
network performance in such large and unseen spaces, we progressively insert
new collision data based on the errors in network inferences. We automatically
label these data using an analytical collision detector and progressively
fine-tune our detection networks. We evaluate our method for collision handling
of complex, 3D meshes coming from several datasets with different shapes and
topologies, including datasets corresponding to dressed and undressed human
poses, cloth simulations, and human hand poses acquired using multiview capture
systems. Our approach outperforms supervised learning methods and achieves
$93.8-98.1\%$ accuracy compared to the groundtruth by analytic methods.
Compared to prior learning methods, our approach results in a $5.16\%-25.50\%$

topology of the universe determines its ultimate fate. If the Weak Energy
Condition is satisfied, open and flat universes must expand forever, while
closed cosmologies can recollapse to a Big Crunch. A similar statement holds
for homogeneous but anisotropic (Bianchi) universes. Here, we prove that
$arbitrarily$ inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies with ""flat"" (including
toroidal) and ""open"" (including compact hyperbolic) spatial topology that are
initially expanding must continue to expand forever at least in some region at
a rate bounded from below by a positive number, despite the presence of
arbitrarily large density fluctuations and/or the formation of black holes.
Because the set of 3-manifold topologies is countable, a single integer
determines the ultimate fate of the universe, and, in a specific sense, most
3-manifolds are ""flat"" or ""open"". Our result has important implications for
inflation: if there is a positive cosmological constant (or suitable
inflationary potential) and initial conditions for the inflaton, cosmologies
with ""flat"" or ""open"" topology must expand forever in some region at least as
fast as de Sitter space, and are therefore very likely to begin inflationary
expansion eventually, regardless of the scale of the inflationary energy or the
spectrum and amplitude of initial inhomogeneities and gravitational waves. Our
result is also significant for numerical general relativity, which often makes
use of periodic (toroidal) boundary conditions.

and teaching of complex system. Thus, in this work, we applied both classical
and a generalized form of Benford's Law, to examine if electrophysiological
data recorded from neuromuscular junction conforms the anomalous number law.
The results indicated that nerve-muscle communications conform the generalized
Benford's law better than the seminal formulation. From our
electrophysiological measurements a biological scenario is used to interpret
the theoretical analysis.

curves. We interpret the obstruction to lifting a finite harmonic morphism of
augmented metric graphs to a morphism of algebraic curves as the non-vanishing
of certain Hurwitz numbers, and we give various conditions under which this
obstruction does vanish. In particular we show that any finite harmonic
morphism of (non-augmented) metric graphs lifts. We also give various
applications of these results. For example, we show that linear equivalence of
divisors on a tropical curve C coincides with the equivalence relation
generated by declaring that the fibers of every finite harmonic morphism from C
to the tropical projective line are equivalent. We study liftability of
metrized complexes equipped with a finite group action, and use this to
classify all augmented metric graphs arising as the tropicalization of a
hyperelliptic curve. We prove that there exists a d-gonal tropical curve that
does not lift to a d-gonal algebraic curve.

behavior because of its spin. A spinless particle also deviates from geodesic
behavior when a test radiation field is superimposed on the Schwarzschild
background: in fact the interaction with the radiation field, i.e., the
absorption and re-emission of radiation, leads to a friction-like drag force
responsible for the well known effect which exists already in Newtonian
gravity, the Poynting-Robertson effect. Here the Poynting-Robertson effect is
extended to the case of spinning particles by modifying the
Mathisson-Papapetrou model describing the motion of spinning test particles to
account for the contribution of the radiation force. The resulting equations
are numerically integrated and some typical orbits are shown in comparison with
the spinless case. Furthermore, the interplay between spin and radiation forces
is discussed by analyzing the deviation from circular geodesic motion on the
equatorial plane when the contribution due to the radiation can also be treated
as a small perturbation. Finally the estimate of the amount of radial variation
from the geodesic radius is shown to be measurable in principle.

extreme value distribution to a sample of block maxima extracted from a time
series. Traditionally, the maxima are taken over disjoint blocks of
observations. Alternatively, the blocks can be chosen to slide through the
observation period, yielding a larger number of overlapping blocks. Inference
based on sliding blocks is found to be more efficient than inference based on
disjoint blocks. The asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator of
the Fr\'{e}chet shape parameter is reduced by more than 18%. Interestingly, the
amount of the efficiency gain is the same whatever the serial dependence of the
underlying time series: as for disjoint blocks, the asymptotic distribution
depends on the serial dependence only through the sequence of scaling
constants. The findings are illustrated by simulation experiments and are
applied to the estimation of high return levels of the daily log-returns of the

determining the distance to these galaxies using the magnitude of the tip of
the RGB, and then apply this approach to these galaxies. We also provide the
full probability distributions for parameters derived using this approach. This
reveals the distance to these galaxies as $5.64^{+0.13}_{-0.15} \, {\rm Mpc}$
and $8.89^{+0.75}_{-0.85} \, {\rm Mpc}$ for Pisces A and B, respectively,
placing both within the Local Volume but not the Local Group. We estimate the
star formation histories of these galaxies, which suggests that they have
recently undergone an increase in their star formation rates. Together these
yield luminosities for Pisces A and B of $M_V=-11.57^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and
$-12.9 \pm 0.2$, respectively, and estimated stellar masses of
$\log(M_*/M_{\odot})= 7.0^{+0.4}_{-1.7}$ and $7.5^{+0.3}_{-1.8}$. We further
show that these galaxies are likely at the boundary between nearby voids and
higher-density filamentary structure. This suggests that they are entering a
higher-density region from voids, where they would have experienced delayed
evolution, consistent with their recent increased star formation rates. If this
is indeed the case, they are useful for study as proxies of the galaxies that
later evolved into typical Local Group satellite galaxies.
